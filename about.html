        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Howdy folks, I'm a Web Designer. By that I mean I think, sketch, wireframe, use Photoshop, and write HTML, CSS and Javascript to help create web applications that make peoples' time on the web easier and hopefully more enjoyable. I'm a part of the badass team at <a href="http://arc90.com"><i>Arc</i>90</a>. Park Slope, Brooklyn is where I call home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm grateful every day to be able to say that I love what I do. Working as a Designer and Developer means every day is an opportunity to learn something new. And not only is it an option, it's encouraged by the people I work with and the web community as a whole.
        </p>

          Outside of web design, I'm proud to say that I'm a Skateboarder. I've been riding a skateboard consistently for over 14 years. It's the hardest, most frustrating and most rewarding thing I've ever done. From the first moment I picked up a board it has given me new eyes and ears to see and hear the world. My life would be profoundly different without it.

        <h1>About This Site</h1>
        <p>
          Like millions of others on the web, this is my little corner of the internet where I share what I'm doing with my work and my life. Designing for yourself is always battle. The current incarnation of this site has taken much longer and gone through a higher number and more drastic revisions than any previous version. I designed and built two other designs close to completion before finally feeling like the aesthetic was an accurate representation of me and my current tastes and style.

        <p>
          No CMS was harmed during the making of this site. I decided early on that it just wasn't necessary. Instead, all of the pages of this site are good ole' HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript. For a web server I decided to try something new and give <a href="http://nginx.org">NGINX</a> a go. I really enjoy working with it. I find configuration to be much more straight-forward than Apache, and it just feels lighter and faster.

          The fonts are coming from the fantastic Typekit. The headings are set in <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts/inconsolata">Inconsolata</a> and this sweet serif is none other than <a href="http://typekit.com/fonts/chaparral-pro">Chaparral Pro</a>.
