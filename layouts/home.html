              <strong>Limbo is an anonymous job platform</strong>.
              We made it to make tech recruiting more humane. Chris came to me
              with the idea and an early prototype
              and invited me to join him as a partner. I wrote more about our
              origin story
              in <a href="/articles/something-new/"><i>Starting Something New</i></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were trying something different with Limbo. Chris and I were
              eager to see something in tech recruiting that we hadn’t seen before
              so we set out to create it. We also wanted to start a business on
              our terms. A business where
              <strong>growth for the sake of growth wasn’t the goal.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We don’t have an exact count, but we know we helped many companies
              find quality candidates that made it to interview processes and a
              number of hires from those. At the beginning I said I’d be happy if
              we could help make one hire. We did that and then some.
            </p>
            <p>
              In March 2018 we moved Limbo to side project status to allow us to
              move on to other opportunities.
              <a href="https://medium.com/@chrisdary/f9d422d8fdd7">Chris wrote</a>
              his thoughts about it.
            </p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              Our approach to business allowed us to focus on designing a slow
              product. Not slow in terms of our speed of production. Slow meaning
              the product doesn’t beg for our customers’ attention every minute.
              We designed Limbo to encourage candidates to take their time and
              think about what type of work would make them happy. We designed
              Limbo to slow hiring managers down to really think what qualities
              they need to see in a potential team member. Limbo is a tool for
              accomplishing tasks, not a thing to engage.
            </p>
            <p>
              From early on, we iterated on the design in browsers. To help that
              process we built and maintained a <a href="https://www.limbo.io/about/patterns">Pattern Library</a>.
              We didn’t use any fancy tech for it. The first iteration of the
              library was a single html file with no styles. We built it up from
              there as we moved along learned more about the design.
            </p>

            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>
              Chris handled the infrastructure and server-side work. Limbo is
              built with Python/Django and runs on AWS by way of Elasticbeanstalk.
              We made use of Elasticsearch for our Profile search capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m a little old-fashioned when it comes to web tech. From the
              start, I wanted Limbo to embrace progressive enhancement. I think
              all sites–or apps–should strive for that, but Limbo in particular
              is a site that can and should function without JavaScript. With
              that, I worked with Chris to make sure we backend support for
              template rendering, form posts, and the like. For each site
              addition we’d identify the core functionality that had to work
              without JS and go from there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our JavaScript setup consists of jQuery, Gulp, Rollup.js, Babel,
              and Prettier. The JS light on-purpose. We wrote the minimum amount
              to get the task at hand done and not a line more.
            </p>

              <strong>
                We had one goal; help elect Hillary Clinton the 45<sup>th</sup>
                President of the United States of America.
              </strong> You know how that ended. What you
              don’t know about is the tireless work of a small team of
              technologists dedicated themselves to from day one of
              the <abbr>HFA</abbr> campaign and through the end and then some.
              You don’t know
              about that because that’s how we designed it. From the beginning,
              our mantra was, “<b>don’t be the story</b>.”
            </p>

            <h4>hillaryclinton.com</h4>
            <p>
              Our team was instrumental in the initial Hillary for America
              website launch. In the days leading up to the April 12, 2015
              launch we helped the HFA tech team and another web development
              vendor implement a Wagtail CMS, implement designs, squash bugs,
              and make sure the the site could handle the massive traffic it
              was about to receive.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the months after launch we continued our work with the growing
              HFA tech team. We played an instrumental role in interviewing
              candidates and making recommendations for designer and engineer
              hires for HFA. We also continued daily work on hillaryclinton.com.
            </p>
            <p>
              Myself along with other members of the Groundwork helped complete
              the frontend engineering necessary for the HFA launch rally in
              New York City. Our team also built the events microservice and
              API that powered the events section of the HFA website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over 14,000 people RSVP’d for the launch rally using backend and
              frontend systems built by our team. This was only the beginning.

            <h3>Leadership</h3>
            <p>
              While I never held the official title, I got to act as a de facto
              Lead of the Frontend Team at The Groundwork. For a time it was
              the largest team at seven excellent humans. I see leadership roles
              as a service position. My primary role during that time was to
              help make sure each member of the team had everything they needed
              to do great work. I didn’t always succeed. In fact, I made
              mistakes daily. But I got the opportunity to try, so I did every
              day.

                ColorMe is a tool to visualize future CSS color
                manipulation functions. It’s also just a fun lil’ color picker.
              </strong>
              I’d read about the potential of Sass-like color manipulation
              coming to CSS. I was also familiar with SassMe–built by a friend
              and former Co-worker–that made working with color manipulation
              functions easier. I had a bit of time off from work and wanted a
              project to tinker with, so I set to build a tool for working with
              the possible future CSS color functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the weeks following the release I added a number features like;
              rrggbbaa support, a color picker, and a few other things I forgot.
              For me, the color function aspect has become secondary. ColorMe
              has turned into my go-to color picker. That wasn’t intended, but
              is a fun side-effect.
            </p>

            <h3>CSS Spec Discussions and OSS contributions</h3>
            <p>
              In January 2017, color() was part of an editor’s draft CSS spec (link).
              Since then, that has changed. It’s unclear what the fate of color
              modification in CSS is, but the syntax will not be color().
              That’s being developed in a different specification.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made use of Ian Storm’s css-color-function package for ColorMe.
              I discovered a couple bugs and needed tweaks to it during
              development and contributed back to the library. Ian made me a
              contributor in late 2017 to help shephard the project along.
              After a few lengthy discussions about the library’s future, work
              as paused for while. It’s not dead, we’re just holding off for a
              while since the CSS spec is in flux.

              “<strong>You can’t do this.</strong>” This was something I got a
              glimpse of and got excited. At the
              WWDC in 2014, Apple made a tiny announcement that JavaScript
              would be supported as a native scripting language. I spent events
              and weekends over the next couple months researching what was
              possible, learning the basics of Objective-C, and building demos
              and writing about what was possible with the new technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              After I proved to myself that I could produce a working native
              app with JavaScript I set out to share what I found with other
              people. For the most part, the results were met with enthusiasm
              and positive feedback. I couldn’t have asked for a better outcome
              from something that was just a fun thing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn’t do much with it for while. Then, I got word that my talk
              proposal on the topic was accepted by MidwestJS 2015. In the
              months leading up to the conference I dove back and learned how
              all the pieces worked together again to put together a talk.
              During that time I also experiemented with a build process for
              it using webpack and started a jQuery-esque UI library for JXA
              called Starstuff.
            </p>

                This was my first conference talk. I’ve had plenty of proposals
                rejected over the years, but this one made it in.

              <strong>Readability was an advocate for readers.</strong>
              From the day Readability launched, I wanted to work on it.
              The original design by
              <a href="http://darrenhoyt.com">Darren</a> blew me away. In those
              early days it seemed like every person I looked up to in design
              was involved in some way.

              <a href="#limbo">Chris Dary</a>, <a href="https://teehanlax.com/story/readability/">Teehan+Lax</a>,
              and so on. The excitement and momentum around it at that time was
              palpable in the Arc90 office and I wanted so bad to be a part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In November 2011 I got the chance. I switched from client work at
              Arc90 to a Designer and Frontend Engineer on the Readability team.
              I was so excited! For about a year I helped continue the high
              standard of design and build iterative improvements to the
              Readability website.
            </p>
            <p>
              In early 2013 we had a gap in the team. This a product that I
              loved and used daily so I asked Rich(link) for a quick chat where
              I asked him if he’d consider me for the vacant role of Product
              Lead of Readability. I was thrilled that Rich and the Readability
              team gave me the thumbs up and trusted me to take on the role.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the next year I helped lead the team on successful efforts to
              rebuild the Chrome extension, modernize the Reading view, and
              relaunch Top Reads. The biggest–and my last–effort I helped lead
              was a complete redesign and rebuild of the iOS app and in tandem
              a redesign of the website. Both included the biggest addition to
              Readability since its launch; Recommendations.
            </p>
            <p>
              I <a href="/articles/2000-days">left Arc90</a> on Feb. 14, 2014.
              The work I got to do and the team I got to do it with during that
              time will always be on a pedestal for me.
