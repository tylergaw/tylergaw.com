  <div class="all-about-me">
    <p class="number-one">
      The most important thing to know about me as a designer, developer,
      and human is that <strong>I give a shit</strong> and I act accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I care about the type and quality of work I’m putting out into the world.
      It’s important that I believe in the motivations and goals of the projects I work on
      and the people I work with. I have plenty of practical skills and
      experience, but the quality of caring is what makes me a great
      designer and developer.

        <h3>On Design</h3>
        <p>
          It’s hard to say you’re a Designer these days without putting a word in front of it.
          I may not have held the titles, but I practice; Product, Web, Graphic, UX, UI,
          and Interaction design. The lines between each are
          blurry. For each project they may happen on their own, all at once, or not at all.
          I take a people-first approach to them all. I make every design
          decision thinking about how it will affect the human
          that it’s for.
        </p>

        <h3>On Development</h3>
        <p>
          Programming is a means to an end. I have ideas and want
          to see them come to life. I use code to make those
          ideas reality. That doesn’t mean that I approach programming
          as a craft with any less enthusiasm or care as design.

          I push myself to learn new languages, frameworks, and practices.
          No language is off limits and I don’t shy away from learning
          difficult concepts. Development technologies are in constant flux
          and I love it.

    Design to me is about influencing human behavior. I use my skills to encourage,
    engage, entertain, entangle, envelop, and enrage.

            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p>
              The start of everything. I do Product, web, graphic, UX, UI,
              and interaction design.

            <p>
              The OG. The backbone of the Web. Accessibility and semantics
              are more important today than ever.

            <h4>CSS</h4>
            <p>
              Responsive by default. Enjoy Sass but
              will use any preproccesor that works or none at all. I use it
              to <a href="https://lab.tylergaw.com">push boundaries</a>.

            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            <p>
              Been writing it since “DHTML” days. Unobtrusiveness
              before cleverness. Currently working day-to-day with
              React + Redux setups.

            <p>
              I sketch, draw, and doodle. I make
              collages. I spend a ton of time in my head dreaming
              about all the things that are possible.

              Been playing with it since v0.4. Will use it for odd

            <h4>PHP</h4>
            <p>
              My first programming language. Used
              it non-stop for three years. Spent quality time with
              <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>.
              Will break it out for all quick and dirty projects.

          <li>
            <h4>Ruby/Rails</h4>
            <p>
              Latest acquisition. Said “yes” to a
              ROR project. Put my nose in a book and learned it.
              A fun language and framework. I look forward to using it more.

            <h4>Python</h4>
            <p>
              Love its syntax and packages.
              Will use it to <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/timebomb">build tools</a>
              to aid in my laziness.

    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>
      I staked my claim on this piece of Internet property in 2006. Since then
      I’ve maintained this site as my portfolio and blog. You can access the source
      code for it <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com">here</a>.
      If you’re interested in that sort of thing.
    <p>
      This is the fifth iteration. The previous versions
      are a testament to how much I’ve grown and how high the
      bar has been raised for quality in Web Design.
