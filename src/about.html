        <p class="number-one">
            The most important thing to know about me as a designer, developer,
            and human is that <strong>I give a shit</strong> and I act accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
            I care immensely about the type and quality of work I’m putting out into the world.
            It’s important that I believe in the motivations and goals of the projects I work on
            and the people I work with. I have plenty of practical skills and
            experience, but the quality of caring is what makes me a great
            designer and developer.

                <h3>On Design</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s hard to say you’re a Designer these days without putting a word in front of it.
                    I may not have held the titles, but I practice; Product, Web, Graphic, UX, UI,
                    and Interaction design. The lines between each are
                    blurry. For each project they may happen on their own, all at once, or not at all.
                    I take a people-first approach to them all. I make every design
                    decision thinking about how it will affect the human
                    that it’s for.
                </p>

                <h3>On Developement</h3>
                <p>
                    Programming is a means to an end. I have ideas and want
                    to see them come to life. I use code to make those
                    ideas reality. That doesn’t mean that I approach programming
                    as a craft with any less enthusiasm or care as design.

                    I push myself to learn new languages, frameworks, and practices.
                    No language is off limits and I don’t shy away from learning
                    difficult concepts. Development technologies are in constant flux
                    and I love it.

        Design to me is about influencing human behavior. I use my skills to encourage,

                            The start of everything. I do Product, web, graphic, UX, UI,
                            and interaction design.

                            The OG. The backbone of the Web. Accessibility and semantics
                            are more important today than ever.

                        <p>
                            Responsive by default. Prefer Sass but
                            will use any preproccesor that works or none at all. I use it
                            to <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com">push boundaries</a>.

                            Been writing it since “DHTML” days. Unobtrusiveness
                            before cleverness. I’ve wielded Backbone,
                            compiled with Require, and built with Grunt.

                            I sketch, draw, and doodle. I make
                            collages. I spend a ton of time in my head dreaming
                            about all the things that are possible.

                            My first programming language. Used
                            it non-stop for three years. Spent quality time with
                            <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>.
                            Will break it out for all quick and dirty projects.

                            Newest acquisition. Said “yes” to a
                            ROR project. Put my nose in a book and learned it.
                            A fun language and framework. I look forward to using it more.

            I staked my claim on this piece of Internet property in 2006. Since then
            I’ve maintained this site as my portfolio and blog. You can access the source
            code for it <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com">here</a>.
            If you’re interested in that sort of thing.

            This is the fifth iteration. The previous versions
            are a testament to how much I’ve grown and how high the
            bar has been raised for quality in Web Design.
