      Some of my earliest memories are of drawing. As a kid I spent hours 
      sketching hundreds of weird characters, redrawing panes from comics, and 
      just doodling whatever was in my head. As an adult, my sketching shifted
      from a creative outlet to a tool of work.
      App screens, brand logos, and system diagrams. But, I still have
      that itch to create for for the sake of creation. 
      These are the results of the scratching.
