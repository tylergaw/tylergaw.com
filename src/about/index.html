    <p>
      The ethical, political, and moral implications of the work I choose is
      everything. Saying; “I’m just doing my job” is not OK for me. The work I do,
      the work we do as an industry, has real effects on real people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m trying to use my skills and experience to put good into the world.

      <h3>On Design</h3>
      <p>
        There are plenty of words and acronyms you can put in front of
        “Designer”. Product, Web, Graphic, UX, UI, IA, etc.
        The lines between each are blurry, and the titles go in-and-out of
        fashion. Depending on the project and team I’m working alongside, I
        practice them all to varying degrees. I prefer to call myself simply; “A Designer.”

      <h3>On Code</h3>
      <p>
        Code is a means to an end. I have ideas and use code to bring them to
        life. That doesn’t mean I approach programming
        as a craft with any less enthusiasm or care as Design. I push myself
        to try new languages, and unserstand new patterns.
        No language is off limits and I don’t avoid trying to learn difficult
        concepts.

    Being a better designer makes me a better engineer and being a better
    engineer makes me a better designer. I’m often asked which I want to do
    more; write code or design. I answer, “yes.”

  Being a better designer helps me be a better engineer.
  <br/>Being a better engineer helps me be a better designer.
  <br/>Neither matter without working to be a better human.

    <h3>About This Site</h3>
    <p>
      I staked my claim on this piece of Internet property in 2006. Since then
      I’ve maintained this site as my portfolio and blog. You can access the source
      code for it <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com">here</a>.
      If you’re interested in that sort of thing.
    <p>
      This is the fifth iteration. The previous versions
      are a testament to how much I’ve grown and how high the
      bar has been raised for quality in Web Design.
