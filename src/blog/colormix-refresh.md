[Last summer](https://tylergaw.com/blog/colormix-mvp/), I built a tool to help visualize the CSS `color-mix` function. [colormix.style](https://www.colormix.style) lets you mix two colors in a given color space and generates the CSS snippet needed to do that with `color-mix`.

For the MVP, I was focused on building the bare minimum to get the idea across. Since then, browser support for `color-mix` as improved. More people are experimenting with and [writing about](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/high-definition-css-color-guide/) `color-mix` and the huge amount of new color-related features in CSS. And, my understanding of `color-mix` and more importantly how new CSS color capabilities work as expanded.

With all that, I’m taking the time to iterate [colormix.style](https://www.colormix.style) beyond an MVP into a more robust, more useful tool.
