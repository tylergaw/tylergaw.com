These are a few things I enjoyed recently. Maybe you’ll enjoy them too.

## Why Fish Don’t Exist

Rachel and I visited [the best bookshop](https://www.fictionbookshop.com/) in Wiscasset, Maine, at the end of September. As usual in a place like that, we wanted to take every book home with us. I was restraining myself. Rachel insisted I get at least one book to go along with her haul.

I chose this one at random because of the title and cool cover. The photo doesn’t do it justice. They used a type of gold leaf for the not blue parts. Based on the subtitle, I thought it was a novel. It’s not a novel.

What it is is a fascinating, frustrating, sad, beautiful ~200 pages that I highly recommend to anyone who reads things. If you do read it, don’t read anything about it before, just go in cold.

The subtitle; 'A Story of Loss, Love, and the Hidden Order of Life' is displayed on a tag sewed to the fish's tail." />

## The Good Life

Sleaford Mods are one of those bands that are guaranteed to confuse and annoy your normie friends. I love them for it.

Their new single, “The Good Life”, from their upcoming album is a banger and the videos (there are two versions of it) are a lot of fun and exude the Mods’ usual casual cool. And Gwendoline Christie!? Her verse is awesome. She would be a welcome addition to any track of theirs.

## A Rant About “Technology”

Ursula K. Le Guin [addresses a reviewer’s claim that she “avoids technology”](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-rant-about-technology) in her science fiction. Her definition of technology feels refreshing and far more accurate than the reviewer’s, and I suppose, the general, modern idea of “technology”.

> We have been so desensitized by a hundred and fifty years of ceaselessly expanding technical prowess that we think nothing less complex and showy than a computer or a jet bomber deserves to be called “technology” at all.
> <cite>— <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-rant-about-technology">A Rant About “Technology” by Ursula K. Le Guin</a></cite>

The piece obviously isn’t about software design or web development, but I can’t help but relate them. This feels like the familiar chorus of assholes over the years who insist that Design or front-end-related code is somehow less than. That these “soft” things like HTML and CSS are, in their view, not real engineering. Somehow “not technology”.

## Kevin Bækkel’s SEVER Part

This whole video is excellent and you should watch it if you’re at all interested in watching skateboarding. Kevin’s part, that starts around <a href="https://youtu.be/6FmNP5SolaY?t=1045"><code>17:25</code></a>, is packed full of some of the most ridiculous and scary god damn things ever done on a skateboard. You should watch it if you’re at all interested in seeing a human do things that seem impossible for a human to do.

Something to keep in mind as you’re watching. On film, every spot looks smaller and easier to skate. In person, these things are taller, rougher, and in general, less accommodating to urethane, steel, wood, and human ambitions.

## Jesse Plemons’ Iconic Characters

There are tons of these are they’re always fun to watch. Getting to hear stories about how an actor approaches their work makes the work that much more fun. Plemons’ episode is an extra fun one because he’s not just giving safe, practiced responses. He’s giving real insight into his approach and experiences. He’s also a great actor so maybe he’s just, you know, acting. Either way, it’s enjoyable. I also just love his outfit.
