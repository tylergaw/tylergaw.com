[Jim tagged me](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/tag-youre-it/). These have been fun to read. Keeping it going.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

Because I wanted to be part of it. When I was new to building web sites, the people I looked up to all had blogs
—and still do. All of their blogs had a huge impact on how I thought about and approached building web sites. I launched this site in 2006, added the blog in 2009. Those were still early years for the Web as we know it today. I wanted to be part of it and having a place to write about my work helped me feel like I was in small way.
