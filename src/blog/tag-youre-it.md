[Jim tagged me](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/tag-youre-it/). These have been a lot of fun to read so happy to keep it going.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I wanted to be part of it. When I was new to building websites (Started around ’04, launched this site in ’06 and added the blog in ’09), the people I looked up to all had blogs—most still do. Those blogs had a massive impact on how I thought about and approached building the Web. Having your own website and blog felt subversive and cool! It felt like this little secret that these folks were in on and I wanted to be part of that.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

This is a static site built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on Netlify. Posts are Markdown files. I don’t get fancy with organizing them, just a <code>blog</code> directory of files named the title of the post. The [code is on GitHub](https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com).

I chose it because it’s light and fully under my control. And after years of this setup, it’s how my brain works best for writing.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Not really, no. For the first iteration of this blog I had an overengineered setup where I would write posts on Tumblr and then pull those into this site using the Tumblr API. I built it all in PHP using Zend Framework and had gone way down a rabbit whole of pulling in most data on the site from other sites using their APIs. But this domain has always been the canonical location. Over the years I’ve used other static site approaches; by hand with [SSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes), then Jekyll, then Metalsmith

There was a stint where I was cross-posting from here to Medium. Was doing that for some idea of wider distribution. That was short-lived though.

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?

Locally in VSCode. In years past it’s been other text editors, but always just in the code. I [open a PR](https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com/pull/92) to merge each post. I’ve also used [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/) for years to help me edit. I don’t have any type of streamlined process there, just copy/paste from VSCode to Hemingway.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

When I’m excited about something new and I feel like I have a solid grasp on it. The majority of my posts are; “Here’s a thing I did and how I did it.” Every post comes after some amount of discovery and learning.

That and seeing other people writing about what they’re up to. [Jenn’s](https://livelaugh.blog/) recent posts on her day-to-day life have been fun to read and are making me want to write more about what I’m up to outside of computers.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

Immediately, but with a caveat. I rarely start drafts and work on them for any more than a couple days. I don’t have a bunch of partially written posts on paper anywhere. What I do have is a ton of ideas for posts that I’ve written and re-written in my head, but never actually typed into a file anywhere.

When I do finally open VSCode and make a new Markdown file, 99% of the time\* that post gets published within a day or two. My usual process is to wake up on a given day and give myself an arbitrary deadline of like 5pm to write and publish. It’s a helpful forcing function.

- I have a [rare draft](htts://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com/pull/91) going nowhere right now. I think it’s because it’s a boring post so I’m not motiviated to write the last few sentences needed for it to be done.

## What are you generally interested in writing about?

My processes for designing and writing code to make things. For Design, I like to show that good design isn’t magic or only for a select few with a natural ability. It’s more about asking questions and putting in time. And everyone can do that.

For code, I write about things I use the most; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Over the years I have mosts about certain libraries, frameworks, or tools. Most of those are outdated by the time I hit publish. But the foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is always relevant.

## Who are you writing for?

Me. This is selfish activity. Even though lots of posts are helpful for other people, the primary target of that help is me. And, putting my thoughts into public is an attention-seeking behavior. Getting attention isn’t a main motivator, but it’s definitely nice.

## What’s your favorite post on your blog?

[“Building OS X Apps with JavaScript”](https://tylergaw.com/blog/building-osx-apps-with-js/). I put a ton of work into that one. It was exciting to see potential in something new and then give myself the time to explore it and do a deep dive on it. And again, the bonus was it got a lot of attention.

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

A partial redesign and content refresh is in the early, still-in-my-head, stage. I’m exploring the idea of what a personal website is for me these days. I want to take that idea and apply it to aesthetics and content.

## Tag ‘em

Always feels strange suggesting someone else write something on their blog, but these are fun to read and was fun to write so, tagging [Dan](https://danleatherman.com), [Pascal](https://www.pascal.com/diary), [Matthias](https://matthiasott.com/), [Max](https://mxb.dev/).

I like how Jim did this, he didn’t ping me directly. He just added me to the tagged section and published the post. Then I saw it when I was going through my RSS reader this morning. I’ll do the same, if you read this, tag you’re it.
