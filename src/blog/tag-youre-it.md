[Jim tagged me](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/tag-youre-it/). These have been fun to read. Keeping it going.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I wanted to be part of it. When I was new to building websites (Started around ’04, launched this site in ’06 and added the blog in ’09), the people I looked up to all had blogs—most still do. Those blogs had a massive impact on how I thought about and approached building the Web. Having your own website and blog felt subversive and cool! It felt like this little secret that these folks were in on and I wanted to be part of that.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

This is a static site built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on Netlify. Posts are Markdown files. I don’t get fancy with organizing them, just a <code>blog</code> directory of files named the title of the post. The [code is on GitHub](https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com).

I chose it because it’s light and fully under my control. And after years of this setup, it’s how my brain works best for writing.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Not really, no. For the first iteration of this blog I had an overengineered setup where I would write posts on Tumblr and then pull those into this site using the Tumblr API. I built it all in PHP using Zend Framework and had gone way down a rabbit whole of pulling in most data on the site from other sites using their APIs. But this domain has always been the canonical location.

There was a stint where I was cross-posting from here to Medium. Was doing that for some idea of wider distribution. That was short-lived though.

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?

Locally in VSCode. In years past it’s been other text editors. I’ve also used [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/) for years to help me edit. I don’t have any type of streamlined process there, just copy/paste from VSCode to Hemingway. I even open PRs for each post.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

When I’m excited about something new and I feel like I have a solid grasp on it. The majority of my posts are; “Here’s a thing I did and how I did it.” Every post comes after some amount of discovery and learning.

That and seeing other people writing about what they’re up to. [Jenn’s](https://livelaugh.blog/) recent posts on her day-to-day life have been fun to read and are making me want to write more about what I’m up to outside of computers.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?
