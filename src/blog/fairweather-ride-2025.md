<p class="entry-intro">This year I set a goal for myself to ride 1,000 miles on my bike.
There’s not any big motivation behind it. I’ve been biking with some regularity for a little over a decade now. I’ve never set a yearly milage goal. I’ve only set small monthly goals. Which, before this year, I only hit once. In the first few months this year, I just decided it would be fun to work towards a goal that was way beyond what I’d ever done in a year to see if I could do it.</p>

Of course, doing something like this, I’m building a website for it.
