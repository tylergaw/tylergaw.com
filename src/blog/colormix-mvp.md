<p>
  Way back in 2017, I <a href="https://tylergaw.com/blog/introducing-colorme/">built ColorMe</a> for working with a proposed CSS color function. That version of the CSS spec didn't end up sticking, so the <code>color</code> function there is no longer valid, but itâ€™s still a fun color picker.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in 2022, there's a new proposal for a CSS color function. This version is named <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix"><code>color-mix</code></a>. It's part of the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#color-mix">CSS Color Module Level 5</a> spec.
