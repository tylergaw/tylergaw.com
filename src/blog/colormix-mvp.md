<p>
  TL;DR: <a href="https://www.colormix.site">colormix.site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/colormix.site"> github.com/tylergaw/colormix.site</a>
</p>
<p>
  Way back in 2017, I <a href="https://tylergaw.com/blog/introducing-colorme/">built ColorMe</a> for working with a proposed CSS color function. That version of the CSS spec didn't end up sticking, so the <code>color</code> function there is no longer valid, but itâ€™s still a fun color picker.
</p>
<p>
  Now, in 2022, there's a proposal for a new CSS color function. This version is named <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix"><code>color-mix</code></a>. It's part of the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/#color-mix">CSS Color Module Level 5</a> spec.
</p>
<p>
  Similar to the deprecated color function, I wanted a quick way to see the results and required code snippet for <code>color-mix</code>. <strong>So I built a new tool to do just that; <a href="https://www.colormix.site">colormix.site</a></strong>.

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>
  This is an MVP and something I'll keep working on. For now, it provides base functionality of <code>color-mix</code>. It takes two colors and mixes them at the percentages provided in the colorspace specified.
</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>
  Unless you're in the habit of fiddling with browser feature flags, this likely won't work completely for you. <code>color-mix</code> is only available in a couple browsers and those require a feature flag to be enabled. At the time of this writing, it's latest Firefox and Safari. Check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix#browser_compatibility">MDN Browser compatibility</a> for details on how to enable it.
