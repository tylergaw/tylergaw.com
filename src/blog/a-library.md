<p>
  <b>Update, early 2021:</b> I changed the name and URL to <a href="/bookshelf">Bookshelf</a>. Just seemed like a better fit.
</p>

<p>
  I don’t read enough books. And when I do, I don’t read a wide enough variety
  of them. I’m working to fix this by doing three things:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’m reading more books</li>
  <li>Always having a book I want to read (that I’m actually interested in, if I don’t like it, I put it down and walk away)</li>
</ol>

<p>
  For step number two, I either buy two books at once or as soon as I
  finish a book, I go get another one. Lately, at the excellent
  <a href="https://www.mcnallyjackson.com/">McNally Jackson</a> on Prince St.
  near my apartment.
</p>

<p>
  The third thing I’m doing is documenting the book I’m reading and the books
  I’ve read in <a href="/library">Library</a>. Nothing fancy, just a list
  book titles, authors, and the month and year I read the book. I’m not making
  an attempt to list books before 2019 right now. Just starting with what’s
  fresh in my mind.
</p>

<p>
  I decided I wanted this after reading
  <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2019/03/21/how-to-read-more-3/">Austin’s, “How to read more”</a>.
  In it, he mentions <a href="https://www.artgarfunkel.com/library/list1.html">Art Garfunkel’s</a>
  list of read books. That list is amazing. I hope to maintain
  my list for even a portion as long as he as.
