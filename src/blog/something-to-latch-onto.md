<p class="entry-intro">
  Three weeks is a short amount of time. It’s a tiny amount of time when it’s the total time you spend employed at a job. And it happens to be the exact amount of time I spent at my most recent job.
</p>

April 2025. A post about a new app landed on my Bluesky via repost from a friend. The app was for something that I’m very into. I used it for a few days. While it was in early stages, it was fun and promising. I immediately thought; “This is something I would love to help build.” After a quick search I saw it was a single person startup. Too early for them to be growing a team, but that would come later. I emailed the founder to tell them how much I was liking the app, and a general intro to plant the seed for a conversation to grow in the future.

At the time I was working at [Summer](https://summer.io). I started there in November 2023. Things were going well. We were building good product, customer conversations were moving, and we all worked well together as a team. I wasn’t looking to make any moves. My plan was to keep helping build the product and company. But, that exciting new app and company, that seemed like it would be a perfect fit for me, was quietly in the back of my mind.

Then, in June 2025, I saw the company put up their first job posts. There were two. One was for a role that was not for me. The other was for a role that was exactly me. I responded to the email thread I had with the founder and told them so and asked if they wanted to meet to talk it through. They did. So we did.

My first day at the company was July 21st, 2025. Within 48 hours I was fairly certain I’d made a mistake. I tried to chalk it up to normal discomfort around starting something new. Told myself to give it time. Two weeks went by. It was not only clear that it wasn’t normal new job jitters, it was crystal clear that I’d made a mistake. Because I was the first hire, it was critical that the founder and I be able to work well together. We did not. This was not going to work. My last day was August 11th, 2025.

I’ve left out specifics because they’re not what’s important to this story. Specifics about the company. What may have been done or not done. What may have been said or not said. What’s important is how it affected me and what I decided to do with that. If you really want to know, buy me a beer sometime, I’ll spill all the tea.

## Now What?

In the days leading up to me leaving, a question kept popping up in my head: “Why do I keep working for these people?!” That sounds a bit petulant. Let me explain.

Going into any work situation with the attitude of: “Why don’t they just listen to me?”, “If they would just do what I say…”, “I know more than them.” etc. etc. is never a good approach. That’s not what I was thinking here. I’ve been lucky to work with smart and talented people throughout my career. Including the short stint in this case. My question was prompted a career of building other peoples’ ideas. Realizing other peoples’ visions. What I was really asking was: “Why don’t I build my own ideas?”, “Why don’t I realize my own visions?”, “Why don’t I have something that’s mine?”

This wasn’t the first time I’ve asked myself these questions, but I’ve always gotten hung up on what I thought was the first step. I’ve always thought: “Once I have a good product idea, then I’ll start a company.” Well, that clearly hasn’t happened. So, I decided to flip it. Start a company first and then work out what I wanted to build.

That’s what I did. By the end of the week I left I had already decided on a name, formed a C Corp, bought domains, set up most of various SaaS tools I’d need, and started the process of figuring out what I wanted to build.

Most of that was busy work. Which is exactly what I needed at the time. Having the job fall apart was a blow. I was bummed. I was pissed. It was important that I not just sit and stew, but instead get busy doing things I knew I’d eventually need.

## How’s That Going?

My company is named Latchbolt Inc. I let myself nerd out on a holding page at [latchbolt.tech](https://latchbolt.tech). My plan right now is to follow the model of a company like [Panic](https://www.panic.com/). I’m not building a single product or even products of the same genre. Latchbolt is a place where I can build any software that I’m inspired to. What I’m inspired to build right now is software for niche audiences. Software that’s made with care for caring people. Software that, hopefully, brings even the smallest joy. I need that. We need that.

The first thing I’m building is an iOS app for collage. I also decided to learn Swift/SwiftUI for this so it’s moving along slow, but it’s moving. I’ll have details and a build ready for initial testing next month.
