<p class="entry-intro">
  Folks in design and technology have a tendency towards negativity. Any day
  of the week you can read Twitter, blog posts, and have conversations with co-workers
  and hear people declare, with self-appointed authority, that anything they don’t
  find value in is bad.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s a non-exhaustive, unordered list of things about my work—maybe yours
  too—that are good.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML is good</li>
  <li>The WHATWG is good</li>

  <li>Progressive enhancement is good</li>
  <li>Being positive is good</li>
  <li>Being earnest is good</li>
  <li>Being kind is good</li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are infinite more things that are good about being a designer and
  engineer. If you read my list and thought; “Thing X is also good, why isn’t it on your list?”.
  It’s not that I don’t think thing X is good. It’s either that I; didn’t think
  of it, or don’t have enough knowledge about it to know it’s good. For those,
  I encourage you to make your own list of Good Things.
