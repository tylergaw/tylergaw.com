These are a few things I enjoyed recently. Maybe you’ll enjoy them too.

## Personal Business

A wonderfuly well-written reminder that not everything needs to scale. Not everything needs to be automated to the nth degree. Doing things slowly, by hand, for niche groups of people is always an option.

<a href="https://www.are.na/editorial/personal-business">“Personal Business” by Charles Broskoski on Are.na</a>.

> …how is a tiny software company supposed to compete with huge and well-funded companies? The answer is that you don’t really have to. You just have to get an understanding of the proper pace and scale of whatever your endeavor is. Get there, and you can outlast anyone.

This is how I’m approaching my work on [Latchbolt](https://latchbolt.tech).

## Victor Jones

At first glance it seems like it could be a gag. That thought dissappears nearly as soon as it appears though. You realize this is very serious and very good. Absurd? Definitely. Odd? You betcha. But that’s exactly why this music fun and interesting. I can’t wait to yell-sing these songs back at Victor in a cramped room with a bunch of other sweaty people as soon as possible.

## The Art of Fauna

This app has gotten a lot of attention. I’m happy to give it more because I’ve been thoroughly enjoying it. It’s a shining example of what software can be when it slows down and gives a shit about people.

## Converge - Audiotree From Nothing

Even if this isn’t your type of music, watch the interviews. They talk about their creative process over the last 30 years as a band. This in particular stood out to me as someone who, in my younger years, has not always been so patient when working with others:

> The art of compromise has not felt so world-ending as it did when we were creating music when we were younger.

While they’re talking music, the same things are true of any creative endeavour. If this is your type of music, you’ve already watched this five times because these versions of the songs rule.
