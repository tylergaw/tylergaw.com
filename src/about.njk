      The ethical, political, and moral implications of the work I choose is
      everything. Saying; “I’m just doing my job” is not OK for me. The work I do,
      the work we do as an industry, has real effects on real people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m trying to use my skills and experience to put good into the world.

      <h3>On Design</h3>
      <p>
        There are plenty of words and acronyms you can put in front of
        “Designer”. Product, Web, Graphic, UX, UI, IA, etc.
        The lines between each are blurry, and the titles go in-and-out of
        fashion. Depending on the project and team I’m working alongside, I
        practice them all to varying degrees. I prefer to call myself simply; “A Designer.”
      </p>

      <h3>On Code</h3>
      <p>
        Code is a means to an end. I have ideas and use code to bring them to
        life. That doesn’t mean I approach programming
        as a craft with any less enthusiasm or care as Design. I push myself
        to try new languages, and unserstand new patterns.
        No language is off limits and I don’t avoid trying to learn difficult
        concepts.

    Being a better designer makes me a better engineer and being a better
    engineer makes me a better designer. I’m often asked which I want to do
    more; write code or design. I answer, “yes.”

    <p>
      I deployed the first–Flash–version of this site Summer of 2006. I built
      v1 during the last months of college to help land my first web design job.
      Fun tidbit, there’s a CD-ROM
      version of that first site. An interface built with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Director">Macromedia Director</a>
      on CD-ROM was the required final project deliverable at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I’ve made iterations on the site every few years to accomplish
      different goals. I’ve changed the design, I’ve changed the work, and most
      important of all I’ve changed. This site is a lot of things. A portfolio
      of design work. A blog. A place to experiement. Above all else, this site
      is a reflection of me.
