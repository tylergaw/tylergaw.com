    <p>
      Since 2006 I’ve made a living as a Designer and Software Engineer, creating 
      world-class digital experiences for humans. In that time, I’ve been 
      fortunate to work with excellent people at a few companies, as a 
      freelancer, and for a short time as a founder.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m trying to use my skills and experience to put good into the world.

    <h2>On design</h2>

      There are plenty of words and acronyms you can put in front of
      “Designer”. Product, Web, Graphic, UX, UI, IA, etc.
      The lines between each are blurry, and the titles go in and out of
      fashion. Depending on the project and team I’m working alongside, I
      practice them all to varying degrees. I prefer to call myself; “A Designer.”

    <h2>On engineering</h2>
    <p>
      Code is a means to an end. I have ideas and use code to bring them to
      life. That doesn’t mean I approach programming
      as a craft with any less enthusiasm or care as Design. I push myself
      to learn new languages, understand new patterns, and keep growing as an engineer.
      No language is off limits and I don’t avoid trying to learn difficult concepts.
    </p>

  <p class="g-main__item bio__outro">
    Being a better designer makes me a better engineer and being a better
    engineer makes me a better designer. I’m often asked which I want to do
    more; write code or design. I answer, “yes.”

    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>
      I deployed the first Flash version of this site Summer of 2006. I built
      v1 during the last months of college to help land my first web design job.
      Fun tidbit, there’s a CD-ROM
      version of that first site. An interface built with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Director">Macromedia Director</a>
      on CD-ROM was the required final project deliverable at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I’ve made iterations on the site every few years to accomplish
      different goals. I’ve changed the design, I’ve changed the work, and most
      important of all I’ve changed. This site is a lot of things. A portfolio
      of design work. A blog. A place to experiement. Above all else, this site
      is a reflection of me.
