        What’s a place? What isn’t? Let’s ask that another way. Who cares? 
        That’s not a rhetorical or flippant question. For something, somewhere 
        to be a “place”, someone has to <b class="highlight--streetcred">care enough</b> to tell people about it. 
        And, tell them where in the world it is. A nowhere becomes a somewhere 
        when someone puts it on a map.

          StreetCred begin in early 2018 with the audacious goal of 
          crowdsourcing the most complete, most up-to-date, and most open 
          point of interest dataset in the world. I joined in June 2018 as 
          the first design and engineering hire. For the next two years I 
          worked with the team to build towards our lofty vision for what 
          mapping POIs could be.

      <h3>Show them the foundation</h3>
      <p>
        A hard part of any app is the onboarding. You want to help folks 
        understand the object and expectations, but you don’t want to over explain. 
        People are smart. With StreetCred we needed a quick, interactive way to 
        explain the game mechanics, without slowing down first run momentum. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed and built the game intro that progressively displays real UI 
        elements to show how the pieces fit together.

          <p>
            Adding places was the heart of the app. Making this flow fast and fun
            was something that took iteration. We started out with something
            a couple steps removed from data entry. A winding form with enough
            questions that by the time you got to the end you forgot where you were.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the fourth iteration (if my memory is correct) we landed on this
            snappy four step process. In under two years, our small but
            enthusiastic community used this flow to add over 100,000 points of interest 
            throughout the world.

    <p>
      Yes. God yes, there’s so much more. We packed 5 years of design and engineering into 2.
      I have a bazillion screens, icons, sketchs, map styles, React Native hacks, and on and on.
      Like everything on this site, this is a living document. More soonish.
