      <p class="project__intro__body">
        This is what happens when I get excited about something. At WWDC in 2014, 
        Apple announced that JavaScript would be supported as a native scripting 
        language. That nugget of information got stuck in my brain. I spent evenings 
        and weekends over the next months researching what the change meant. And
        what new things were possible.

  </a> #}

    <p>
      FIXME: Learning the basics of Objective-C, and
      building demos and writing about what was possible with the new
      technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I proved to myself that I could produce a working native app
      with JavaScript I set out to share what I found with other people. For
      the most part, the results were met with enthusiasm and positive
      feedback. I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better outcome from something
      that was just a fun thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didnâ€™t do much with it for while. Then, I got word that my talk
      proposal on the topic was accepted by MidwestJS 2015. In the months
      leading up to the conference I dove back and learned how all the
      pieces worked together again to put together a talk. During that time
      I also experiemented with a build process for it using webpack and
      started a jQuery-esque UI library for JXA called Starstuff.
    </p>

        <h3>Speaking</h3>
        <p>
          I was able to take my show on the road with this one. What I enjoyed
          most about developing these talks was getting the chance to revisit
          the topic. Each time Iâ€™m back to the project I could see it with
          fresh eyes and come up with new things I couldnâ€™t before because I
          was too deep in.

            <p>
              This was my first proper conference talk. Iâ€™ve had plenty of proposals
              rejected over the years, but this one made it in.

              In the early days of Jennâ€™s EXTREMELY CHILL social gathering, 
              she invited folks to give short talks. I used that as an excuse to 
              make Springsteen-themed slides.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Soghoian">Sal</a>. He
            sent me a short note to say he saw the post and thought it was cool
            and thanks for working with the technology. Of all the recognition I
            got for this project, this felt the best.
