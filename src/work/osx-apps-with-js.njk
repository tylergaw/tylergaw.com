        This is what happens when I get excited about something. At WWDC in 2014, 
        Apple announced that JavaScript would be supported as a native scripting 
        language. That nugget of information got stuck in my brain. I spent evenings 
        and weekends over the next months researching what the change meant. And
        what new things were possible.

    <p class="project__shout">
      <strong>TODO</strong>: This page needs a thorough edit. For
      clarity, story, and Iâ€™m sure spelling and grammar.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I proved to myself that I could produce a working native app
      with JavaScript I set out to share what I found with other people. For
      the most part, the results were met with enthusiasm and positive
      feedback. I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better outcome from something
      that was just a fun thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didnâ€™t do much with it for while. Then, I got word that my talk
      proposal on the topic was accepted by MidwestJS 2015. In the months
      leading up to the conference I dove back and learned how all the
      pieces worked together again to put together a talk. During that time
      I also experiemented with a build process for it using webpack and
      started a jQuery-esque UI library for JXA called Starstuff.
    </p>

    <h3>Speaking</h3>
    <p>
      I was able to take my show on the road with this one. What I enjoyed
      most about developing these talks was getting the chance to revisit
      the topic. Each time Iâ€™m back to the project I could see it with
      fresh eyes and come up with new things I couldnâ€™t before because I
      was too deep in.

    <p>
      This was my first proper conference talk. Iâ€™ve had plenty of proposals
      rejected over the years, but this one made it in. As I was developing this
      talk, I started a small UI library project. I never did anything with it
      after the talk, but I called it <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/starstuff" target="_black" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starstuff</a>
      and itâ€™s still available on GitHub. Maybe Iâ€™ll have a reason to revive it
      one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereâ€™s a video of the talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcU2VqRs6DA" target="_black" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.
      Iâ€™ve been told itâ€™s good, but still canâ€™t bring myself to hear my own voice so Iâ€™ve never seen it.
