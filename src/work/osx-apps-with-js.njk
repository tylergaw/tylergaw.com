          ‚Äú<strong>You can‚Äôt do this.</strong>‚Äù This was something I got a
          glimpse of and got excited. At the WWDC in 2014, Apple made a tiny
          announcement that JavaScript would be supported as a native scripting
          language. I spent events and weekends over the next couple months
          researching what was possible, learning the basics of Objective-C, and
          building demos and writing about what was possible with the new
          technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I proved to myself that I could produce a working native app
          with JavaScript I set out to share what I found with other people. For
          the most part, the results were met with enthusiasm and positive
          feedback. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better outcome from something
          that was just a fun thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn‚Äôt do much with it for while. Then, I got word that my talk
          proposal on the topic was accepted by MidwestJS 2015. In the months
          leading up to the conference I dove back and learned how all the
          pieces worked together again to put together a talk. During that time
          I also experiemented with a build process for it using webpack and
          started a jQuery-esque UI library for JXA called Starstuff.
        </p>

          <p>
            This was my first conference talk. I‚Äôve had plenty of proposals
            rejected over the years, but this one made it in.

            An email from former Apple automation product manager,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Soghoian">Sal</a>. He
            sent me a short note to say he saw the post and thought it was cool
            and thanks for working with the technology. Of all the recognition I
            got for this project, this felt the best.
