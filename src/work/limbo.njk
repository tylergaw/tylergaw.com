          <strong>Limbo is an anonymous job platform</strong>. We made it to
          make tech recruiting more humane. Chris came to me with the idea and
          an early prototype and invited me to join him as a partner. I wrote
          more about our origin story in
          <a href="/articles/something-new/"><i>Starting Something New</i></a
          >.

          We were trying something different with Limbo. Chris and I were eager
          to see something in tech recruiting that we hadn’t seen before so we
          set out to create it. We also wanted to start a business on our terms.
          A business where
          <strong>growth for the sake of growth wasn’t the goal.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t have an exact count, but we know we helped many companies
          find quality candidates that made it to interview processes and a
          number of hires from those. At the beginning I said I’d be happy if we
          could help make one hire. We did that and then some.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March 2018 we moved Limbo to side project status to allow us to
          move on to other opportunities.
          <a href="https://medium.com/@chrisdary/f9d422d8fdd7">Chris wrote</a>
          his thoughts about it.
        </p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          Our approach to business allowed us to focus on designing a slow
          product. Not slow in terms of our speed of production. Slow meaning
          the product doesn’t beg for customers’ attention every minute. We
          designed Limbo to encourage candidates to take their time and think
          about what type of work would make them happy. We designed Limbo to
          slow hiring managers down to really think what qualities they need to
          see in a potential team member. Limbo is a tool for accomplishing
          tasks, not a thing to engage.
        </p>

        <h4>Pattern Library</h4>
        <p>
          From early on, we iterated on the design in browsers. To help that
          process I built and maintained a
          <a href="https://www.limbo.io/about/patterns">Pattern Library</a>.

            Our pattern library helped us keep consistent design while
            collaborating and moving fast.

        <p>
          We didn’t use any fancy tech for it. The first iteration of the
          library was a single html file with no styles. I built it up from
          there as we moved along and learned more about our needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p>
          I’m a little old-fashioned when it comes to web tech. From the start,
          I wanted Limbo to embrace progressive enhancement. I think all
          sites–or apps–should strive for that. Limbo in particular is a site
          that can and should function without JavaScript. With that, I worked
          with Chris to make sure we had backend support for template rendering,
          form posts, and the like. For each site addition we’d identify the
          core functionality that had to work without JS and go from there.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our JavaScript setup consists of jQuery, Gulp, Rollup.js, Babel, and
          Prettier. The JS light on-purpose. We wrote the minimum amount to get
          the task at hand done and not a line more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chris handled the infrastructure and server-side work. Limbo is built
          with Python/Django and runs on AWS by way of Elasticbeanstalk. We made
          use of Elasticsearch for our Profile search capabilities.
