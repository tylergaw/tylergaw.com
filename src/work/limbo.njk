        Limbo was an anonymous job platform. We made it to
        make tech recruiting more humane. Chris came to me with the idea and
        an early prototype and invited me to join him as a partner. I wrote
        more about our beginnings in <a href="/blog/something-new/">Starting Something New</a>.

    <p>
      We were trying something different with Limbo. Chris and I were eager
      to see something in tech recruiting that we hadn’t seen before so we
      set out to create it. We also wanted to start a business on our terms.
      A business where
      <strong>growth for the sake of growth wasn’t the goal.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We don’t have an exact count, but we know we helped a handful of companies
      find quality candidates that made it to interview processes and a
      few hires from those. At the beginning I said I’d be happy if we
      could help make one hire. We did that and then some.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March 2018 we moved Limbo to side project status to allow us to
      move on to other opportunities.
      <a href="https://medium.com/@chrisdary/f9d422d8fdd7">Chris wrote</a>
      his thoughts about it.
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      Our approach to business allowed us to focus on designing a slow
      product. Not slow in terms of our speed of production. Slow meaning
      the product doesn’t beg for customers’ attention every minute. We
      designed Limbo to encourage candidates to take their time and think
      about what type of work would make them happy. We designed Limbo to
      slow hiring managers down to really think what qualities they need to
      see in a potential team member. Limbo is a tool for accomplishing
      tasks, not a thing to engage.

    <h3>Pattern Library</h3>
    <p>
      From early on, we iterated on the design in browsers. To help that
      process we built and maintained a pattern and component library.
    </p>
    <p>
      We didn’t use any fancy tech for it. The first iteration of the
      library was a single HTML file with no styles. We built it up from
      there as we moved along and learned more about our needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>
      I’m a little old-fashioned when it comes to web tech. From the start,
      I wanted Limbo to embrace progressive enhancement. I think all
      sites–or apps–should strive for that. Limbo in particular is a site
      that can and should function without JavaScript. With that, I worked
      with Chris to make sure we had backend support for template rendering,
      form posts, and the like. For each site addition we’d identify the
      core functionality that had to work without JS and go from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our JavaScript setup consisted of custom state handling, jQuery, Gulp, Rollup.js, Babel, and
      Prettier. The JS was light on-purpose. We wrote the minimum amount to get
      the task at hand done and not a line more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris handled the infrastructure and server-side work. Limbo was built
      with Python/Django and runs on AWS by way of Elasticbeanstalk. We made
      use of Elasticsearch for our Profile search capabilities.
