        We had one goal; help make Hillary Clinton the 45<sup>th</sup> President 
        of the United States of America. You know how that ended. What you might 
        not know about is the tireless work of a small team of technologists 
        who dedicated themselves to the <abbr title="Hillary for America">HFA</abbr> campaign. 
        You don’t know about that because that’s how we designed it.
        From the beginning, our mantra was, “don’t be the story.”

    <h3>Hillary for America</h3>
    <p>
      Our web services for collecting donations, email subscriptions, identity,
      and event creation were the foundation of the Hillary for America
      technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with our microservice APIs, our team was also instrumental in the initial Hillary for America website
      launch. In the days leading up to the April 12, 2015 launch we helped
      the HFA tech team and another web development vendor stand up a
      Wagtail CMS, implement designs, squash bugs, and make sure the the
      site could handle the massive traffic it was about to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the months after launch we continued our work with the growing HFA
      tech team. We played a key role in interviewing candidates
      and making recommendations for designer and engineer hires for HFA. We
      also continued daily work on the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myself along with other members of the Groundwork helped complete the
      front-end engineering necessary for the HFA kickoff rally in New York
      City in early summer 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over 14,000 people RSVP’d for the launch rally using backend and
      frontend systems built by our team. This was only the beginning.

    <h3>The Developer Center</h3>
    <p>
      This was one of my babies during my tenure. Our web services not only
      powered the Hillary for America tech, they were also available for non-profit
      organizations to build with. The Developer Center was the documentation portal for
      all users of The Groundwork services. Over the 3 years I worked at
      The Groundwork, I got have a lot of fun designing and building this website.

    <h3>Blocks</h3>
    <p>
      The Groundwork Blocks were highly configurable drop-in widgets for collecting
      payments and email subscriptions. We built them to allow our customers
      a way to quickly implement donation collections and email subscriptions
      with little to no engineering resources. With a single <code>div</code>
      and a <code>script</code> tag, customers had full access to our APIs.

    <h3>The Humans</h3>
    <p>
      While I never held the official title, I got to act as a de facto Lead
      of the Frontend Team at The Groundwork. For a time it was the largest
      team at seven excellent humans. I see leadership roles as a service
      position. My primary role during that time was to help make sure each
      member of the team had everything they needed to do great work. I
      didn’t always succeed. I made mistakes daily. But I got the
      opportunity to try, so I did every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      My teammates were the best group of humans I’ve ever worked with. I’m
      proud to still be able to count them as friends years after it all ended.
    </p>
    <p class="project__shout">
      <strong>Note</strong>: What I have here is a sliver of the
      work we did. One day I'll make a static archive of as much of the
      front-end that we built as possible. Because it was just too good to not
      be online to share.
