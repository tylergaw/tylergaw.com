        We had one goal; help make Hillary Clinton the 45<sup>th</sup> President 
        of the United States of America. You know how that ended. What you might 
        not know about is the tireless work of a small team of technologists 
        who dedicated themselves to the <abbr title="Hillary for America">HFA</abbr> campaign. 
        You don’t know about that because that’s how we designed it.
        From the beginning, our mantra was, “don’t be the story.”

    <p>
      Our team was instrumental in the initial Hillary for America website
      launch. In the days leading up to the April 12, 2015 launch we helped
      the HFA tech team and another web development vendor implement a
      Wagtail CMS, implement designs, squash bugs, and make sure the the
      site could handle the massive traffic it was about to receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the months after launch we continued our work with the growing HFA
      tech team. We played an instrumental role in interviewing candidates
      and making recommendations for designer and engineer hires for HFA. We
      also continued daily work on hillaryclinton.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myself along with other members of the Groundwork helped complete the
      frontend engineering necessary for the HFA launch rally in New York
      City. Our team also built the events microservice and API that powered
      the events section of the HFA website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over 14,000 people RSVP’d for the launch rally using backend and
      frontend systems built by our team. This was only the beginning.
    </p>

    <h3>Leadership</h3>
    <p>
      While I never held the official title, I got to act as a de facto Lead
      of the Frontend Team at The Groundwork. For a time it was the largest
      team at seven excellent humans. I see leadership roles as a service
      position. My primary role during that time was to help make sure each
      member of the team had everything they needed to do great work. I
      didn’t always succeed. I made mistakes daily. But I got the
      opportunity to try, so I did every day.
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      We did a lot of this. Some year I’ll actually write something here about
      my process and outcomes. In the meantime, other teammates wrote about 
      their process. You should read these.
