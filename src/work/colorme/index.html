            ColorMe is a tool to visualize future CSS color manipulation
            functions. Itâ€™s also just a fun lilâ€™ color picker.
          </strong>
          Iâ€™d read about the potential of Sass-like color manipulation coming to
          CSS. I was also familiar with SassMeâ€“built by a friend and former
          Co-workerâ€“that made working with color manipulation functions easier.
          I had a bit of time off from work and wanted a project to tinker with,
          so I set to build a tool for working with the possible future CSS
          color functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the weeks following the release I added a number features like;
          rrggbbaa support, a color picker, and a few other things I forgot. For
          me, the color function aspect has become secondary. ColorMe has turned
          into my go-to color picker. That wasnâ€™t intended, but is a fun
          side-effect.

        <h3>CSS Spec Discussions and OSS contributions</h3>
        <p>
          In January 2017, color() was part of an editorâ€™s draft CSS spec
          (link). Since then, that has changed. Itâ€™s unclear what the fate of
          color modification in CSS is, but the syntax will not be color().
          Thatâ€™s being developed in a different specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made use of Ian Stormâ€™s css-color-function package for ColorMe. I
          discovered a couple bugs and needed tweaks to it during development
          and contributed back to the library. Ian made me a contributor in late
          2017 to help shephard the project along. After a few lengthy
          discussions about the libraryâ€™s future, work as paused for while. Itâ€™s
          not dead, weâ€™re just holding off for a while since the CSS spec is in
          flux.
