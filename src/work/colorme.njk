        ColorMe was originally a tool to visualize a previous version of 
        CSS color manipulation functions. Today, itâ€™s just a fun little color picker.
        Tomorrow, it might again be a tool to visualize in progress CSS color functions.

        <strong>TODO</strong>: Thereâ€™s a spec for new color functions to do this.

        ColorMe into now.

      Iâ€™d read about the potential of Sass-like color manipulation coming to
      CSS. I was also familiar with SassMeâ€“built by a friend and former
      Co-workerâ€“that made working with color manipulation functions easier.
      I had a bit of time off from work and wanted a project to tinker with,
      so I set to build a tool for working with the possible future CSS
      color functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the weeks following the release I added a number features like;
      rrggbbaa support, a color picker, and a few other things I forgot. For
      me, the color function aspect has become secondary. ColorMe has turned
      into my go-to color picker. That wasnâ€™t intended, but is a fun
      side-effect.

    <h3>CSS Spec Discussions and OSS contributions</h3>
    <p>
      In January 2017, color() was part of an editorâ€™s draft CSS spec
      (link). Since then, that has changed. Itâ€™s unclear what the fate of
      color modification in CSS is, but the syntax will not be color().
      Thatâ€™s being developed in a different specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made use of Ian Stormâ€™s css-color-function package for ColorMe. I
      discovered a couple bugs and needed tweaks to it during development
      and contributed back to the library. Ian made me a contributor in late
      2017 to help shephard the project along. After a few lengthy
      discussions about the libraryâ€™s future, work as paused for while. Itâ€™s
      not dead, weâ€™re just holding off for a while since the CSS spec is in
      flux.
