<p class="entry-intro">
  At 2 ½ years old my placeholder image Sketch plugin was showing its age. It was also showing signs of typical side-project neglect. I decided to make it a priority to get <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/day-player" title="View Day Player on GitHub">Day Player</a> back in working order. In doing so, I would also need to educate myself on the latest in Sketch Plugin development.
</p>

<p>
  Day Player has a limited scope. It requests images from placeholder image services and places them in Sketch documents. This <code>3.0.0</code> rewrite and release hasn't changed the scope. I did end up cutting two features and adding a new one.
</p>

<h2>What got removed?</h2>
<p>
  The first feature cut was the placeholder service Lorempixel.com. I removed it because it does not support <code>https</code>. Day Player doesn't transport sensitive data, but for me it’s a no-go to use a service without <code>https</code> support.
