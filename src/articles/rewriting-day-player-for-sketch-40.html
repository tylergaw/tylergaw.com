<p class="entry-intro">
  At 2 ½ years old my placeholder image Sketch plugin was showing its age. It was also showing signs of typical side-project neglect. I decided to make it a priority to get <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/day-player" title="View Day Player on GitHub">Day Player</a> back in working order. In doing so, I would also need to educate myself on the latest in Sketch Plugin development.
</p>

<p>
  Day Player has a limited scope. It requests images from placeholder image services and places them in Sketch documents. This <code>3.0.0</code> rewrite and release hasn't changed the scope. I did end up cutting two features and adding a new one.
</p>

<h2>What got removed?</h2>
<p>
  The first feature cut was the placeholder service <a href="http://lorempixel.com/">Lorempixel.com</a>. I removed it because it doesn't support <code>https</code>. The plugin doesn't transport sensitive data, but I decided against using a service without <code>https</code> support.
</p>
<p>
  The second feature cut was <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/day-player/pull/9">remembering user values for each service</a>. I cut this for time only. I didn't want to hold up getting it released any longer for a non-essential feature. There's a good chance I'll circle back and add this in the future. Or, if you're feeling up to it, <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/day-player#contributing-to-this-project">open a pull request</a>.
</p>

<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<p>
  The one new feature is the ability to add an image with the same size and dimensions <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/day-player#creating-images-with-dimensions-and-position-of-existing-layers">as an existing layer</a>.
</p>

<p>
  This was an addition inspired by a <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/day-player/issues/27">user request</a>. While it's not exactly what the user was asking for, it feels close enough to get the job done. And as a user myself, a welcome addition.
</p>

<h2>What’s next?</h2>
<p>
  As expected, within a day or two of release, the first "this doesn't work" <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/day-player/issues/37">issue was opened</a>. After a quick back and forth, it seems we've isolated the issue to macOS Sierra. I'm a slow new OS adopter, so I still haven't reproduced the issue. Sooner than later I'll update a machine and find and fix the issue. If you have any tips for what may have changed, let me know here or on that issue.
