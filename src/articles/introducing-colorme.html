<p class="entry-intro">
  Sass has been my go-to for years. But for a while now, I've wanted to try a new styling setup with PostCSS and the cssnext plugin. I love the idea of writing future CSS syntax today and using tooling more aligned with other tools I'm used to. This personal site is a perfect test bed to try this new setup.
</p>
<p>
  The first step I took was an inventory of my Sass usage. I needed to know what features I was using to make sure I found a replacement in the new setup. Here's a list of what I was using on this project:
</p>

<h2>Preparing</h2>
<p>
  Before getting to new syntax or other fun I needed to do some yak shaving. The project was using a file structure typical for Sass usage. I used the leading underscore naming convention for partials. And included the required <code>scss</code> extension. I used two directories to loosely organize Sass files. <code>modules</code> housed Sass that didn't produce CSS. Things like variables, placeholder classes, and mixins. <code>partials</code> housed all CSS-producing Sass.
</p>
<p>
  This was the <a href="">beginning file</a> structure:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-none">css/
  scss/
    modules/
      _module.scss
      ...
    partials/
      _partial.scss
      ...
    tylergaw.scss
</code></pre>
<p>
  Each Sass partial gets imported in <code>tylergaw.scss</code>.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-scss">@import "modules/setup";
@import "modules/reset";
@import "modules/fonts";
</code></pre>
