<p class="entry-intro">
  This is a technique I used recently to create flexible,
  repeating patterns with SVG with CSS <code>mask</code>. There’s a working demo on
  <a href="https://codepen.io/tylergaw/pen/mdJpdVm?editors=1100">CodePen</a>.
  This post describes motivation and implementation details.
</p>

<p>
  The need came from something I designed at <a href="https://streetcred.co">work</a>.
  I gave the bottom of the header on each page a little squiggle to make it a bit
  more interesting than a straight line. Along with that, I designed a <a href="https://streetcred.co/patterns#color">color system</a>
  for each type of page. Common pages parade in purple, company content is true blue,
  blog posts read in red, and contests own orange. With StreetCred I’ve been
  throwing a rainbow of bright colors to see what’s fun and what sticks.

  Along with the current colors, we’re getting ready to ship new features that
  use even more colors. We’ll make pages for those and they’ll need themed banner
  squiggles.
</p>

<h2>How Should this Work?</h2>
<p>
  For that design, I needed a seamless, horizontally repeating pattern. I wanted
  SVG so it was crisp at any size. And I only wanted a single SVG image that
  I could color using CSS. Because we could have n-number of colors, creating
  a new SVG for every color wasn’t a good option. The squiggly banner using this
  approach is live on <a href="https://streetcred.co">streetcred.co</a>. Let’s
  look at an isolated example to see how the pieces fit together.
</p>

<h3>Creating the SVG</h3>
<p>
  First, I made a quick doodle in Sketch using the vector tool. Because I wanted
  I little squiggly line, I left the path open. The important part was to make
  sure it was seamless when repeated horizontally. I did that by making sure
  the first point and last point were at the same location on the y axis. And
  that the bezier curve leading to them was flat by the time it reached the
  edge of the artboard. This is a simple shape, so that’s easy to eyeball.
  A more complex design would involve more work.
