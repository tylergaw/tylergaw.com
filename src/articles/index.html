      <h2>Why Write?</h2>
      <p>
        I write about my work to help me better understand what
        I think, why I do what I do, and to help others. Sometimes I'm just
        showing off.

      Progressive Web Apps or Sites or whatever you want to call them are
      incredible. I finally made one. This is a long post about my process.

      Starting Something New
    </a>
    <p>
      On September 13, 2017 Chris Dary and I launched our new business, Limbo.
      This is a short story about how it came to be and what I think about it.

      The Impact of Flash
    </a>
    <p>
      An exchange with a fellow designer about the end of Flash has me pausing
      and thinking about the technology’s impact on me and the Web.

      New ColorMe Features
    </a>
    <p>
      After two weeks of usage and great feedback, I made a handful of bug fixes
      and feature additions to the tiny color tweaker that could.

      Introducing: ColorMe
    </a>
    <p>
      ColorMe is a site I built to make working with the CSS Color Function
      easier. It provides a UI for applying adjusters to a base color and gives
      a visual of the adjustments.

      From Sass to PostCSS
    </a>
    <p>
      Sass has been my go-to for years. But for a while now, I've wanted to try
      a new styling setup with PostCSS and cssnext. This is an account of the
      steps I took to make the change.

      Rewriting Day Player for Sketch 40+
    </a>
    <p>
      The Sketch team provides a robust, ever-evolving plugin environment. My
      placeholder image plugin was in need of a rewrite to get it up to speed with
      the latest plugin practices.

    <a href="/articles/overawe">Overawe</a>
    <p>
      For a few months in 2015 I spent my nights and weekends building a strange
      little art project. I used HTML/CSS/JS to create a world where narration is
      unreliable, messages are inconsistent, and sometimes it’s all just a joke.

    <a href="/articles/building-osx-apps-with-js">Building OS X Apps with JavaScript</a>
    <p>
      OS X Yosemite introduced JavaScript for Automation. This makes
      it possible to build native OS X apps using good ol’ JS. This article
      covers the basics and walks through building an example app.

    <a href="/articles/media-seek-from-url">Media Seek from URL</a>
    <p>
      I wrote a quick bit of JavaScript to control the time position of
      audio and video elements via a URL query string. As a bonus I
      modded the script to work with embedded Soundcloud players.

    <a href="/articles/how-i-manage-nginx-config">How I Manage Nginx Config</a>
    <p>
      NGINX site configuration is fairly straightforward, but managing
      the files for it can be a bit cumbersome. I use git and
      Github to make the process quicker and more comfortable.

    <a href="/articles/a-logo-design-process">A Logo Design Process</a>
    <p>
      I wanted a new logo/branding for a redesign of this site
      and for other promotional crud; business cards, stickers,
      coozys, whatever's cool. Here's a look into the creation process.

    <p>
      Starting a new design is an exciting, weird, and sometimes
      frustrating process. No two designs start the same way, but
      for me, they tend to follow similar paths. This is a look
      into how I'm starting a redesign of my site.

    <p>
      The opening titles of the show True Detective are incredible.
      I wanted to see if I could create a similar style title
      sequence using CSS.

    <p>
      After an incredible 5+ years, I made the difficult decision
      to move on from my position at Arc90 and Readability.
      This is an account of my time there.

      I love drawing goofy things with Paper. I wanted a quick
      way to put all those goofy drawings on the Web.

    <a href="/articles/webvtt-cuemarker">WebVTT Cuemarker</a>
    <p>
      The Web Video Text Track format is easy enough to work
      with, but marking cue times can be a bit of a chore. I
      wrote a small tool to make it a little easier.

      Brooklyn is the place to be the second week of
      October 2012. If you're looking to meet new folks and
      build an awesome project, we have just the event for you.

    <a href="/articles/reacting-to-media-queries-in-javascript">Reacting to Media Queries in JavaScript</a>
    <p>
      I was looking for a way for Javascript to know when a media query
      condition was met or not met. While window.matchMedia provides the
      main functionality, I wanted something that was a little more automatic.

    <p>
      HTML form validation is evolving in a big way. In this little ditty
      I lay out a process for making browser generated validation errors
      super cool!

      Side projects can be great opportunities to flex some muscle on new
      skills. In this article I discuss doing just that with a side project
      in need of a facelift.

      I've been attending the Refresh NYC meet-ups as of late. At our last
      meet-up I volunteered to do a presentation on some new and exciting
      things happening with CSS.

    <p>
      It was a silly "pop-in-your-head-in-the-shower" idea. Kinetic type
      with CSS. Is that possible? Will browsers just die under the stress?
      I had to find out.

      Web design is hard, that's why it's fun and why not everyone does it.
      With this I'll explain why I take some joy in dealing with the sticky
      situations that "that" browser gets me in.

      Version 2 of tylergaw.com carried me through a year of freelancing
      and helped me land my current gig at Arc90. But after two years it's
      starting to show its age. Version 3 is a step in a new direction and
      as always a challenging and fun undertaking.
