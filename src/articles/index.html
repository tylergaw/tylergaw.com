      ColorMe is a site I built to make working with the CSS Color Function

      a visual of the adjustments.

      From Sass to PostCSS
    </a>
    <p>
      Sass has been my go-to for years. But for a while now, I've wanted to try
      a new styling setup with PostCSS and cssnext. This is an account of the
      steps I took to make the change.

      Rewriting Day Player for Sketch 40+

    <p>
      The Sketch team provides a robust, ever-evolving plugin environment. My
      placeholder image plugin was in need of a rewrite to get it up to speed
      with the latest plugin practices.

    <p>
      For a few months in 2015 I spent my nights and weekends building a strange
      little art project. I used HTML/CSS/JS to create a world where narration
      is unreliable, messages are inconsistent, and sometimes it’s all just a
      joke.

    <a class="listed-item__link" href="/articles/building-osx-apps-with-js"
      >Building OS X Apps with JavaScript</a
    >
    <p>
      OS X Yosemite introduced JavaScript for Automation. This makes it possible
      to build native OS X apps using good ol’ JS. This article covers the
      basics and walks through building an example app.

      >Media Seek from URL</a
    >
    <p>
      I wrote a quick bit of JavaScript to control the time position of audio
      and video elements via a URL query string. As a bonus I modded the script
      to work with embedded Soundcloud players.

      >How I Manage Nginx Config</a
    >
    <p>
      NGINX site configuration is fairly straightforward, but managing the files
      for it can be a bit cumbersome. I use git and Github to make the process
      quicker and more comfortable.

    >
    <p>
      I wanted a new logo/branding for a redesign of this site and for other
      promotional crud; business cards, stickers, coozys, whatever's cool.
      Here's a look into the creation process.

    <p>
      Starting a new design is an exciting, weird, and sometimes frustrating
      process. No two designs start the same way, but for me, they tend to
      follow similar paths. This is a look into how I'm starting a redesign of
      my site.

    <p>
      The opening titles of the show True Detective are incredible. I wanted to
      see if I could create a similar style title sequence using CSS.

      After an incredible 5+ years, I made the difficult decision to move on
      from my position at Arc90 and Readability. This is an account of my time
      there.

      I love drawing goofy things with Paper. I wanted a quick way to put all
      those goofy drawings on the Web.

    <p>
      The Web Video Text Track format is easy enough to work with, but marking
      cue times can be a bit of a chore. I wrote a small tool to make it a
      little easier.

    <p>
      I was looking for a way for Javascript to know when a media query
      condition was met or not met. While window.matchMedia provides the main
      functionality, I wanted something that was a little more automatic.

      It was a silly "pop-in-your-head-in-the-shower" idea. Kinetic type with

      Web design is hard, that's why it's fun and why not everyone does it. With

      Version 2 of tylergaw.com carried me through a year of freelancing and
      helped me land my current gig at Arc90. But after two years it's starting
      to show its age. Version 3 is a step in a new direction and as always a
      challenging and fun undertaking.
