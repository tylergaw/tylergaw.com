      On September 13, 2017 Chris Dary and I launched our new business, Limbo.
      This is a short story about how it came to be and what I think about it.

      Introducing: ColorMe

    <p>
      ColorMe is a site I built to make working with the CSS Color Function
      easier. It provides a UI for applying adjusters to a base color and gives
      a visual of the adjustments.

      From Sass to PostCSS
    </a>
    <p>
      Sass has been my go-to for years. But for a while now, I've wanted to try
      a new styling setup with PostCSS and cssnext. This is an account of the
      steps I took to make the change.

      The Sketch team provides a robust, ever-evolving plugin environment. My
      placeholder image plugin was in need of a rewrite to get it up to speed with
      the latest plugin practices.

    <p>
      For a few months in 2015 I spent my nights and weekends building a strange
      little art project. I used HTML/CSS/JS to create a world where narration is
      unreliable, messages are inconsistent, and sometimes it’s all just a joke.

    <a class="listed-item-link" href="/articles/building-osx-apps-with-js">Building OS X Apps with JavaScript</a>
    <p>
      OS X Yosemite introduced JavaScript for Automation. This makes
      it possible to build native OS X apps using good ol’ JS. This article
      covers the basics and walks through building an example app.

    <a class="listed-item-link" href="/articles/media-seek-from-url">Media Seek from URL</a>
    <p>
      I wrote a quick bit of JavaScript to control the time position of
      audio and video elements via a URL query string. As a bonus I
      modded the script to work with embedded Soundcloud players.

    <p>
      NGINX site configuration is fairly straightforward, but managing
      the files for it can be a bit cumbersome. I use git and
      Github to make the process quicker and more comfortable.

    <a class="listed-item-link" href="/articles/a-logo-design-process">A Logo Design Process</a>
    <p>
      I wanted a new logo/branding for a redesign of this site
      and for other promotional crud; business cards, stickers,
      coozys, whatever's cool. Here's a look into the creation process.

    <p>
      Starting a new design is an exciting, weird, and sometimes
      frustrating process. No two designs start the same way, but
      for me, they tend to follow similar paths. This is a look
      into how I'm starting a redesign of my site.

    <p>
      The opening titles of the show True Detective are incredible.
      I wanted to see if I could create a similar style title
      sequence using CSS.

      After an incredible 5+ years, I made the difficult decision
      to move on from my position at Arc90 and Readability.
      This is an account of my time there.

    <p>
      The Web Video Text Track format is easy enough to work
      with, but marking cue times can be a bit of a chore. I
      wrote a small tool to make it a little easier.

    <p>
      I was looking for a way for Javascript to know when a media query
      condition was met or not met. While window.matchMedia provides the
      main functionality, I wanted something that was a little more automatic.

      It was a silly "pop-in-your-head-in-the-shower" idea. Kinetic type
      with CSS. Is that possible? Will browsers just die under the stress?
      I had to find out.

      Web design is hard, that's why it's fun and why not everyone does it.

      Version 2 of tylergaw.com carried me through a year of freelancing
      and helped me land my current gig at Arc90. But after two years it's
      starting to show its age. Version 3 is a step in a new direction and
      as always a challenging and fun undertaking.
