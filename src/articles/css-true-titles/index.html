            The <a href="http://youtu.be/ZRPpCqXYoos">opening titles</a> to the
            show True Detective are incredible. CSS contains the building
            blocks necessary to create a similar style title sequence. I tried my
            hand it and came up with fun results. Here's the
            <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/">demo</a> and the
            <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/css-true-titles">source code</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing I have to do is issue the disclaimer. This is an
            experimental project. Things will most likely go wrong when you view
            it. I'm pushing on the browser pretty hard to get it to do things it
            maybe wasn't intended to. Also, due to limited suppport
            of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-masking-1">CSS masking</a>
            you'll only see the full effect in Chrome, Opera, and possibly Mobile Safari.
            The animations will work in other browsers, but things will look strange.
        </p>
        <h2>The Masking</h2>
        <p>
            There's a whole lot going on in each shot of the TD titles. You should
            read the write up about it on <a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/true-detective/">Art of the Title</a>.
            The main effect that I wanted to recreate was the use of human silhouettes
            to mask shots. They use video clips for the masks and the content being
            masked, but I stuck with still images to keep things a little easier.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://tylergaw.com/articles/assets/post-image-true-titles-mask-example.jpg"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                An example of using a human to mask footage in the True Detective titles
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            I'm accomplishing masking using the CSS <code>mask</code>
            property. As I mentioned, browser support for it is currently
            limited. I'm going to break down the first title
            card to explain how the masking is
            implemented.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://tylergaw.com/articles/assets/post-image-true-titles-opener-card.jpg"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                A still of the first title card.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Each title card is an <code>li</code> element. They contain base
            styles like width, height, position, etc. Within each <code>li</code>
            is markup specific to that card. Below is the markup for the elements
            that make up the opening card.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="composition animated"&gt;
  &lt;div class="town animated">&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="human">&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 class="copy animated"&gt;
  &lt;b class="role">This is a&lt;/b&gt; CSS Experiment
&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
            The containing <code>div</code> element with the class of "composition"
            houses all the images. I'm using a containing element here so I can move
            and scale the "human" and the "town" together, while still being able
            to move and scale each independently. I'm also applying the mask
            to the composition element. The "human" and "town" elements have background
            images applied to them.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/img/opener-human.png"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                The partially transparent human image, which doubles as the mask
                for the opening card.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            All of the images are from the <a href="http://flickr.com/commons">Flickr Commons</a>.
            I cropped, clipped, and pushed their pixels around in Photoshop until
            they felt right. Some of them have kind of ratty clipping paths, but
            you can't really seen them with everything moving. I was able to bring
            the file size down some because of that.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/img/opener-town.png"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                The background image for the town element.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            I want to be able to move the "town" element from right to left and
            left to right. If I applied the mask to that element, the mask would
            move with the town causing it to not line up properly with the human image.
            The mask needs to be applied to an element above it, the composition element.
            Since CSS masks are only concerned with the opaque and transparent
            portions of an image, I can reuse the human image as the mask for the
            "composition" element using the CSS below. Areas appearing under
            opaque portions will be visible, those under transparent portions will
            be invisible.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">.opener .composition {
  ...
  -webkit-mask: url("opener-human.png") top left/cover no-repeat;
  mask: url("opener-human.png") top left/cover no-repeat;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            The shorthand <code>mask</code> has similar properties as <code>background</code>.
            URL, position, size, repeat. It was important that all of the images and mask
            had the same <code>background-size</code> setting. In this case they
            are all set to <code>cover</code>. That prevents the images from becoming
            too short or too narrow so that you see the edges of them. I could
            have set a fixed width and height on the cards to avoid this
            altogether, however it was more fun to embrace the unstable
            environment that is a Web browser by letting everything remain fluid.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of the title cards follow a similar pattern with adjustments
            based on the the number of images that were needed and the animations
            that were put into place. You can see the source scss for each
            card <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/css-true-titles/tree/master/css/scss/partials">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>The Animations</h2>
        <p>
            There are a few different animations happening during the sequence.
            The main animation–or timeline–is responsible for cutting from one card to the next
            and looping back to the first after the last. Within each card there
            are one or more animations that control composition elements and individual
            elements.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <h3>The main timeline</h3>
        <p>
            Once I came up with all the cards I wanted, I tweaked
            the total length until the pacing felt about right at 36 seconds. The .54 seconds was
            added the to make the sequence length match the length of the audio track.
            The track ended up an odd length because I edited it with <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>
            and I've never been able to tame that beast. Has anyone?
        </p>
        <p>
            As the diagram shows, the length of each title card is a percentage
            of the total sequence length. That length is how long that card will
            be visible. Figuring out the length for each card took quite a bit
            of trial and error to get right. If each card was the same length, coming
            up with a percentage for each would be easy: <code>100% / number of cards = length</code>.
            That was not the case with this sequence.
            There are four title cards and one "bump" card.
            The bump card contains no text, it's there as a break and
            extra visual information (AKA, it looks cool). Because of that, the
            bump needed to be shorter than the title cards. The photography card
            doesn't contain as much motion as the other cards and that was making it feel too long.
            I stole time from it to give to the last card. I wanted the last card with my Twitter info
            to be longer than the others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each card needs keyframes at multiple positions. I'm going to show
            the second title card–the director card–as an example, because they get a little strange.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">@keyframes director {
  0%, 22.9%, 46%, 100% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }

  23%, 45.9% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            I'm going to explain this backwards. Starting at 23% of the main
            timeline length I want the card to be visible and on the screen. It should stay
            visible until 45.9% of the main timeline length.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first set of frames says that the card should be invisible and
            off screen from 0% until 22.9% and again from 46% to 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm using the 0.1% intervals to make sure there is no visible interpolation
            of the opacity or transform. I want the transition from one card to
            the next to be a quick cut. The opacity is still interpolating from
            0 to 1 and transform from -100% to 0, but it's too fast to be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm using <code>translateX</code> to move the invisible cards
            out of the viewport so they don't obsure any elements of the current
            visible card. That was happening when I was only using <code>opacity</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, getting the timing correct on each card was a lot of trial
            and error. Making changes a percentage at a time. You can see
            the full scss for the main timeline animation
            <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/css-true-titles/blob/master/css/scss/partials/_general.scss#L115">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>A sub timeline example</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://tylergaw.com/articles/assets/post-image-true-titles-director-card.jpg"
                alt="">
            <figcaption>
                A still of the director title card.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The director card is the most complex card with five separate animations happening
            simultaneously. Here's the markup for the card.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div class="composition animated"&gt;
  &lt;div class="street animated">&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="trees animated">&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="human">&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 class="copy animated"&gt;
  &lt;b class="role">Directed by&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;a href="https://tylergaw.com">Tyler Gaw&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
            Anything with the class of "animated"–you guessed it–has an animation
            applied to it. The fifth animation is on a pseudo-element. Below is
            list of each animated element and description of what is animated.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>composition</b>: Houses all the images. Over the span of 17 seconds
                it is slightly scaled, skewed along the X axis, and translated on the X axis.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>street</b>: A <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/img/director-street.png">masked image</a>.
                Its X and Y positions are changed over 18 seconds using <code>translate</code>.
            </li>
            <li><b>trees</b>: A <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/img/director-trees.png">masked image</a>.
                Its X and Y positions are changed over 18 seconds using <code>translate</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>copy</b>: The card info is slightly scaled and translated
                on the X and Y axes over 17 seconds. The copy moves somewhat in
                tandem with the composition.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>pseudo-element</b>: I'm using the <code>::before</code> selector
                on the trees element to add an additional subtle detail I called a "blip". It is a
                <a href="http://lab.tylergaw.com/css-true-titles/img/director-blip.png">image of fire</a>
                that is displayed shortly to give a little more detail to animation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A quick note on using <code>translate</code>. Always use it to animate
            elements on X and Y axes instead of using positioning properties like
            left, right, top, bottom. Also try to use it instead of animating
            the <code>background-position</code> property. Using <code>translate</code>
            gives much smoother animations and uses less CPU. <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/">Paul</a>
            explains it better than I can.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the animations have their <code>animation-direction</code> set
            to <code>alternate</code>. I did this so there would be no visible jumps
            back to the starting position of the properties. If you watch the
            sequence multiple times, you're likely to see the animations running
            in different directions.
        </p>

            You can see the full source scss for the director card
            <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/css-true-titles/blob/master/css/scss/partials/_card-director.scss">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Pausing the animations</h3>
        <p>
            In the markup there is a class of "animated" applied to any animated
            element. I'm using that as way to pause and unpause all of the
            animations using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state"><code>animation-play-state</code></a>.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">.paused .animated,
.paused .title-card .animated {
  -webkit-animation-play-state: paused;
  animation-play-state: paused;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            There is some <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/css-true-titles/blob/master/js/controls.js">light JavaScript</a> to allow the pause/play
            button to add and remove the class of "paused" from the
            body element, the CSS above takes care of the rest.
        </p>
        <h2>This was tough!</h2>
        <p>
            When I was working on this project, I realized there was a lot going
            on to make it happen, however I didn't realize how much I was on
            autopilot during the process. Sitting down and trying to explain—in
            words—what I did was difficult. If you read this far I hope there's a
            useful technique or trick that you picked up along the way. If not,
            I hope it was an interesting look into what goes on in my brain when
            building this type of thing.
