<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020"
    >Realign 2020</a
  >” series. In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of
  this site. I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design and
  content will evolve through the series and beyond.
</p>

<h3>Accessiblility</h3>
<p>All colors should meet WCAG 2.0 level AA or else</p>
<h3>Equally-considered themes</h3>
<p>
  Dark and light themes shouldn’t only be inverse of the other. Each should be
  its own considered, curated experience.
</p>
<h3>Media queries in SVG</h3>
<p>
  Embed color themes in your SVG elements so they respect color prefences when
  they're in the wild.
</p>
<h3>Future variety</h3>
<p>Use a lot of colors now so you can use even more colors later.</p>
