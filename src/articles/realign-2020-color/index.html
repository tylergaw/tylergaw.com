<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020"
    >Realign 2020</a
  >” series. In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of
  this site. I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design and
  content will evolve through the series and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  Going into this, I didn’t know exactly what colors I wanted, but I knew I
  wanted to use a lot of them. I wanted my color usage to come across as
  deliberate, but I also wanted to leave the door open for future additions.
  With this update, I have a design where no hue, shade, nor tint is off limits.
</p>
<p>
  In this interation I’ve added a light color scheme and selector. Along the
  way, accessiblity was a guiding principle. I’ve put a lot effort into making
  sure the colors meet WCAG contrast ratios. It’s not perfect, but moving in the
  right direction.
</p>

<h2>A working combination</h2>
<p>
  I started with what I had in place. A dark grey background
  <code class="color-swatch-code" style="--color: #292929;">#292929</code>,
  not-quite-white text
  <code class="color-swatch-code" style="--color: #f8f8f8;">#f8f8f8</code>, and
  a pink accent color
  <code class="color-swatch-code" style="--color: #ff607f;">#ff607f</code>.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve used the dark grey and offwhite on this site since 2018. I’ve played with
  the accent color over the years. The original was a muted green. Then maybe a
  purple. I changed it every few months for fun.
</p>
<p>
  The color usage felt a bit trapped with only a single accent color. That's an
  early thing I worked on for this. I still wanted a primary accent color to
  highlight links, but I wanted at least one more accent color for
  embellishment.
</p>
<p>
  My process for picking color combinations is definitely not a science. It’s
  slow and tedious trail and error. Pick a color. Pick another. See if they work
  together. Repeat. The first color I got excited about was a new accent color
  for the dark scheme,
  <code class="color-swatch-code" style="--color: #00eb9b;">#00eb9b</code>.
</p>

<p>
  To get to this color I started with emerald green. I didn’t have a hex for it,
  I just did a image search for “emerald green” and picked the one I thought
  looked the best. The reason I started with that color? My hair was sorta
  emerald green/blue at the time. See what I mean by not a science?
</p>

<p>
  From there I checked contrast with my dark scheme background color
  <code class="color-swatch-code" style="--color: #292929;">#292929</code> using
  the
  <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"
    >WebAIM contrast checker</a
  >. I’d use this green for text links so I needed it to have a ratio that met
  at least WCAG AA for normal text. Using contrast as a guidline for choosing
  colors like this is super helpful. Choosing colors for a design is a wide-open
  process, so anything that helps narrow the scope is welcome.

<h2>Accessiblility</h2>

<h2>Equally-considered themes</h2>
<p>
  Dark and light themes shouldn’t only be inverse of the other. Each should be
  its own considered, curated experience.
</p>

<h2>Media queries in SVG</h2>
<p>
  Embed color themes in your SVG elements so they respect color prefences when
  they're in the wild.
</p>

<h2>User preference switch</h2>
