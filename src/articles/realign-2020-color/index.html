<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020">Realign 2020</a>” series.
  In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of this site.
  I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design
  and content will evolve through the series and beyond.
