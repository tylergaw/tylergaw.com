<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020"
    >Realign 2020</a
  >” series. In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of
  this site. I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design and
  content will evolve through the series and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  Going into this, I didn’t know exactly what colors I wanted, but I knew I
  wanted a lot. I wanted my color usage to come across as deliberate. Planned.
  But at the same time unbounded. I wanted a design where no hue, shade, or tint
  is off limits or unwelcome.
</p>
<p>
  Along with new colors, I also added a light color scheme. Or “light mode.”
  Depending on your system color mode, this text is either muddy brown on
  off-white or off-white on charcoal. There's also an override button in the
  footer, in case you prefer one scheme over the other. More on that setup later
  in this post.
</p>

<h2>Choosing colors</h2>
<p>
  Choosing colors for a design is a lot of play. With this design I started with
  what I had in place already. A dark grey background
  <code class="color-swatch-code" style="--color: #292929;">#292929</code>,
  off-white text
  <code class="color-swatch-code" style="--color: #f8f8f8;">#f8f8f8</code>, and
  a pink accent color
  <code class="color-swatch-code" style="--color: #ff607f;">#ff607f</code>. I
  started there, with the dark scheme. Light mode colors could come later.
</p>

<h3>Toxic green</h3>
<p>
  The first color I worked with was the primary accent color. Its job is to make
  the design come alive. Its also the color of text links. Because of that, the
  color I used needed to meet a minimum WCAG color contrast ratio. I used high
  contrast ratios as a guidepost throughout this process.
</p>
<p>
  This primary accent color was important to get just right.
</p>
<p>
  From the beginning, I saw yellows, greens, yellowish greens, and blue greens
  in my head. I went through the rainbow, but it was clear this small section of
  the spectrum was where I'd find the right color.
</p>
<p>
  The green couldn't be a lime. That with the off-white and charcoal gave off a
  campy-horror vibe that didn't feel right. Towards yellow felt stale. I wanted
  an unnatural green. A weird green.
</p>
<p>
  My hair at the time was a strange mix of blue and emerald green. The result of
  one of my recent home dye jobs. I thought that could be a place to look. I
  didn't have a hex value so I did an image search for “emerald green.” When I
  found one that looked cool, I used an eyedropper to pick a hex. If you haven't
  noticed, my process for color is not a science.
</p>

<p>
  I don’t have the exact hex I started with, but it gave me a solid foundation
  to work from. It got me a tiny sliver of the color spectrum. I had help
  getting to the final color. I mentioned before I need colors to meet certain
  contrast ratios. To do that I used the
  <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/"
    >WebAIM contrast checker</a
  >. I compared the green with the charcoal background. I adjusted the hue and
  lightness by tiny amounts until I got the contrast I needed.
</p>
<p>
  Letting WCAG contrast ratios influence aesthetic decisions can be a little
  uncomfortable. As an experienced designer, I have a trained eye that I trust
  to choose colors that work well and look good. But, that's not the whole
  story. My instincts towards subtlety often lead to colors that look fantastic,
  but are low in contrast. Low contrast text can be difficult for people to see.
  Color needs more than my instincts. So I let go of a bit of control.
</p>
<p>
  Letting go can produce great results. Results that make a design accessible
  and enjoyable to more people. And in this case, helped me get what I was
  looking for. This was the first color I got excited about in this process.
  This unnatural green. This weird green. This toxic green.
</p>

</figure>

<h3>Boo</h3>
<p>
  The design having a single accent color made me feel like I painted myself
  into a corner. It felt too formulaic. Also, the design was using the accent
  color to highlight links, but then sometimes only as accent. I needed to
  introduce at least one more accent color. One that I'd use only for
  embellishment. Toxic green would only be for links and other clickable
  elements.
</p>

<p>
  I went through the process again. A slow trial and error. Clicking around on
  the color picker. Looking for one that worked with that toxic green and the
  rest of the design. I landed on a muted blue.
</p>

<p>
  The blue itself had to look great, but the interplay between it and the other
  colors was most important.
</p>

    #9db4ff
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  From here it's color confetti. I starting make a spotted, dusty background
  texture. At first it was all off-white flecks, but felt like there was room
  for more. So I started picking colors at almost random to use for the dust.
  The hue is all over the spectrum, but I tried to keep them in a similar tone.
  This part was just fun.
</p>

<p>
  Now that I have a foundation of color in place, I can keep going with it. As I
  continue developing content, I can also iterate on the design. Finding more
  opportunities to introduce color as I move along.
</p>

<h2>Light mode</h2>
<p>
  In the last year or so it seems almost every site and app has announced their
  “dark mode.” This site has had light text on a dark background for almost a
  decade now. With this realign, I also wanted to provide an alternative color
  scheme. The alternative would be a light version.
</p>

<p>
  Dark and light schemes shouldn’t only the inverse of the other. They should be
  fully considered designs that stand on their own. The color selection process
  was the same as the others. Trial and error. Make sure the colors meet WCAG
  contrast ratios. Find combinations that work well together.
</p>

<figure>
  <div class="realign-color-fig realign-color-light-scheme"></div>
  <figcaption>
    fig 3: Text, primary, and secondary colors of the light scheme; #3f3d31,
    #c01458, c2d838
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Like the dark scheme, the light scheme has a textured background. The shape
  and placement of the flecks are the same, but I chose different colors. Colors
  that fit the tone of the light accents and worked well on the off-white
  background.
</p>

<h3>Your choice</h3>
<p>
  Any color mode you choose at the system level should not be the final say you
  have in the color mode of a website or app. Preference over text and
  background color changes with context, time of day, and mood. For this site, I
  prefer the dark scheme. But, I don’t use the dark mode on my system, macOS.
  Other folks will have the same preference.
</p>
<p>
  With that in mind, I included a color scheme toggle in the footer that
  remembers your preference. Not across devices, but in browser.
  <span class="realign-color-scheme-toggle-invite"
    >Give it a try with this button:
    <button class="realign-color-scheme-toggle">Switch scheme</button></span
  >
</p>
<h3>Mode code</h3>
<p>
  The code I used for this is a modified version of
  <a
    href="https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/create-a-user-controlled-dark-or-light-mode/"
    >Andy Bell’s</a
  >. The logic for picking a color scheme goes like this. If you haven’t chosen
  a color scheme using the provided button, go with the system setting. If you
  have a system level dark mode set, you’ll see the dark scheme. Light mode,
  light scheme.
</p>
<p>
  If you’ve been to this site before and changed the scheme using the toggle
  button, that will be the scheme you see. If you have a system level dark mode
  set, but you’ve chosen light scheme here, you’ll see the light scheme. The
  inverse is also true.
</p>
<p>
  An interesting thing I ended up doing with the code for the scheme picker is
  splitting it into two parts. I include the first part right after the opening
  <code>body</code> tag. This code’s job is to determine the correct color
  scheme on page load. It checks <code>localStorage</code> for a
  <code>user-color-scheme</code> item. The value of that item will be the string
  <code>"light"</code> or <code>"dark"</code>. If found, that’s the color scheme
  displayed. If not, the code falls back to the system level color scheme. I’m
  able to determine the system level scheme from a CSS custom property named
  <code>"user-color-scheme"</code>. The default of that prop is
  <code>"dark"</code>. Using the <code>prefers-color-scheme: light</code> media
  query I set it to <code>"light"</code>. This approach is from Andy’s example.
</p>
<p>
  The reason I include this as an internal script before the document loads is
  to avoid a flash of the other scheme. If I included this as an external script
  and waited for document load, you’d see that quick flash of incorrectly styled
  content. This makes the code a tiny bit harder to maintain, but it works fine
  for my purposes. I keep the code in
  <a
    href="https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com/blob/346982b2da07b2369b5bd2101c50488dfa246157/partials/scheme.js.html"
    >a partial</a
  >
  that I include in my handlebars templates.
</p>
<p>
  The second part of the code is also in
  <a
    href="https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com/blob/346982b2da07b2369b5bd2101c50488dfa246157/partials/scripts.html#L10"
    >a partial</a
  >. I include this before the closing <code>body</code> tag. This code’s job is
  to make the scheme switcher button work. Because it’s in the footer, it can
  wait until the document loads.
</p>
<p>
  Something I added to Andy’s example is code that responds to system level mode
  changes. He mentions it as a potential improvement:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Observe changes to the user’s dark/light mode setting, probably via the
    prefers-color-scheme media query and update the default state accordingly
  </p>
  <cite>
    “<a
      href="https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/create-a-user-controlled-dark-or-light-mode/#heading-wrapping-up"
      >Create a user controlled dark or light mode</a
    >”
  </cite>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This addition makes sure the button stays in sync with the system level
  setting. Without this code, the CSS-driven parts of the display update, but
  not the JS-driven parts like the button.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const mql = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: light)");

mql.addListener((event) => { 
  console.group("System color scheme change");
  const systemScheme = getCSSProp("--scheme-system"); 
  const userScheme = localStorage.getItem(schemeKey); 
  console.info("System color scheme changed to", systemScheme); 
  
  if (!userScheme) { 
    console.info("No user color scheme chosen, using the system scheme"); 
  } else { 
    console.info(`User choice takes preference, using the ${userScheme} scheme`); 
  } 
  
  updateSchemeBtn(userScheme || systemScheme); 
  console.groupEnd(); 
});</code></pre>

<p>
  I use a
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia"
    ><code>MediaQueryList</code></a
  >
  event to keep an eye on <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>. When it changes,
  the callback does the same <code>localStorage</code> and custom prop lookup
  that happens on page load.
</p>

<p>
  I left logging in place to announce changes and decisions made. I hadn’t used
  <code>console.group()</code> and <code>groupEnd()</code> before. They’re super
  helpful for keeping logs organized.

<h2>Code color</h2>
<p>
  If you’re reading this post on my site, you’ll see syntax highlighted code
  samples. Like the earlier <code>matchMedia</code> example.
  <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> is my highlighter of choice. I’ve had
  a modified
  <a
    href="https://github.com/ericwbailey/a11y-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/dist/prism/a11y-dark.css"
    >dark a11y theme by Eric Bailey</a
  >
  in place for a couple years. For this update, combined the dark and light
  themes so they change with the rest of my site scheme. I moved all the theme
  colors to CSS custom props and used similar selectors to choose the correct
  theme.
</p>
<p>
  This approach results in a bit a repetition, but gets the job done. You can
  see the full port on
  <a
    href="https://github.com/tylergaw/tylergaw.com/blob/cffe306ca5447e2b17cbe5ac8669a8d909837ee3/src/css/modules/prism-a11y.css"
    >GitHub in prism-a11y.css</a
  >.
</p>

<h2>Color naming</h2>
<p>
  I’ll end with another fun one.
