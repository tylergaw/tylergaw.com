<p class="entry-intro">
  On December 15, 2016 I became unemployed. This was the first time in my career the unemployment was not my choice. The entirety of the company I work for was rif'd. If you’re unfamiliar, that’s a “reduction-in-force”. We were flat out of money to pay salaries. Rif was the best case scenario for us at the time.
</p>

<p>
  We were lucky. The founder and team all wanted to keep doing what <a href="https://thegroundwork.com/">we were doing</a>. They were able to get together enough contract work to pay salaries for the team members that stuck around. We were hired back in late February 2017.
</p>

<p>
  In that couple month span I was able to stop and breathe for the first time in two and half years. I got to work on <a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/rewriting-day-player-for-sketch-40">fun</a> <a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/sass-to-postcss">side</a> <a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/introducing-colorme">projects</a> and think about things I wanted out of my work, career, and life.
</p>

<p>
  All of my thoughts I want I wanted led to two bigs things I wanted in 2017; a <strong>business that I owned</strong> and a potential <strong>passive income stream</strong>.
