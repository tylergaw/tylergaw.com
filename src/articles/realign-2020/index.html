<p class="entry-intro">
  Like other designers, I enjoy updating my personal site every so often. In my
  case I do a <a href="/about#versions">major iteration</a> every couple years with minor tweaks between.
  This current incarnation is almost two years old and I’m ready to make major
  changes.
</p>

<p>
  When I launched this design in 2018 I remember thinking this would
  be my last site. I wasn’t under any illusion that I wouldn’t update this site
  again in the future. Only that I had a solid foundation that I could
  build on for a long time. Even if the changes where major, they’d still be
  iterations of existing content and aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
  I have two main motivations for this year’s realign. First, I want to present
  my work from the last few years in a more complete way. The 2018 verison of
  this site listed projects, but didn’t go into much detail. There’s a lot there
  I want to surface. I’m looking for my next role so I need to present my work
  in a way that show’s what I'm capable of.
</p>
<p>
  Second, I just want it to look cooler and weirder. Heavy emphasis on weird.
  With every iteration of this site since I launched it in 2006 I’ve made
  concerted efforts to make it look much different than the standard web
  designer portfolio/blog website. I don’t have anything against other folks’ sites,
  I just want mine to look different and strange.
</p>

<h2>Writing about it</h2>
<p>
  Plenty of other designers are iterating on their personal sites and writing
  about their process. I enjoy reading those. So, I’m going to follow their
  lead and write about my process.
</p>
<p>
  I’ve already started the process in a rough way. For the last few weeks I’ve
  let myself noodle on different areas of the design. I spent a lot of hours
  pushing points around in Illustrator for an updated logo and some fun
  typography squigglevision. I spent, I don’t know how long just fiddling with
  CSS in browser. I wanted time to play a while before I set out to really get
  updated content and design together.
</p>

<p>
  With the initial play I have a rough idea of what I’ll write about. I’ll
  update this post as I go to keep a reference. Some of the topics
  will change and I’ll add more as I go, but below is a rough outline.
</p>

</ul>

<p>
  After the the illustration work and in browser playing, I jumped back into
  Sketch to try to get at a more concrete plan and to play more. I won’t continue
  in Sketch to get a “complete” design. I prefer to do a lot in CSS. But here's a zoomed
  out screenshot of my current mess to get an idea of what I’m up to.

<p>
  You can see shell pages started for projects. I have six main buckets of work
  that I want to present in detail. There’s a lot more, but those are the ones that I’ll have the time and energy to pull off right now.
</p>

<p>
  Here we go again.
