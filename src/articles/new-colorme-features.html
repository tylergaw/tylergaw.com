<p class="entry-intro">
  Since <a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/introducing-colorme">releasing it</a> the week before last, ColorMe has had time to simmer and I've gotten a bunch of great feedback from folks. In that time I've made a few additions. New features include; support for hsl(a) and rrggbbaa colors. Red, green, and blue color adjusters. And the option to choose the format of the output color. In this post I write about the work went into the updates.
</p>

<p>
  The first changes made I snuck in the day after release. Those were minor improvements to the color adjusters for touch devices. Or more accuratly, devices without `hover` support. During initial build and usage, I knew the adjusters had usability issues on mobile devices, but decided to get it releases first and then circle back to it. This was also among the first feedback.
</p>
<p>
  I didn't change the UI completely for touch devices, but what I did was increase the size of the thumb on the adjuster range sliders in <a href="https://github.com/tylergaw/colorme/pull/4">this pull request</a>. The problem the UI had was the horizontal scrolling interfering with the range sliders. The thumb of the sliders was too hard to get a hold of with a finger.
</p>
<p>
  By default, the CSS for the range slider thumbs gives large, almost comical size. And even larger on `:active`.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.adjusterValRange::-webkit-slider-thumb {
  ...
  height: 1.6rem;
  margin-top: -0.8rem;
  width: 1.6rem;
}

.adjusterValRange::-webkit-slider-thumb:hover,
.adjusterValRange::-webkit-slider-thumb:active {
  margin-top: -1.8rem;
  height: 2.5rem;
  width: 2.5rem;
}</code></pre>

    The size of an inactive and an active slider thumb on touch devices. It looks odd here, but easier to see and handle when you're using a finger.

<p>
  To decrease the thumb size on devices with <code>hover</code> support , I used the <code>hover</code> media query. This is available in the Media Queries Level 4 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#hover">spec</a>.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">@media (hover) {
  .adjusterValRange::-webkit-slider-thumb {
    ...
    height: 0.75rem;
    margin-top: -0.3rem;
    width: 0.75rem;
  }

  .adjusterValRange::-webkit-slider-thumb:hover,
  .adjusterValRange::-webkit-slider-thumb:active {
    margin-top: -0.5rem;
    height: 1.1rem;
    width: 1.1rem;
  }
}</code></pre>
