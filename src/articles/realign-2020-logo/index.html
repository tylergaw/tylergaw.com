<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020">Realign 2020</a>” series.
  In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of this site.
  I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design
  and content will evolve through the series and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  The fonts I’ve chosen for this site have run the gamut over the years. Handwritten,
  illustrated, web-safe only, monospaced, serif, questionable, and so on. The
  last few years I’ve leaned on chunky, sturdy fonts. Fonts that—to me—say;
  “hard work gets done here.” That fits my approach to design and engineering.
</p>

<p>
  I’ll continue this series in a few days with “Realign 2020: ?.”
