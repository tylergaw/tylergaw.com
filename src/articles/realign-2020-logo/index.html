<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020">Realign 2020</a>” series.
  In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of this site.
  I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design
  and content will evolve through the series and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  Eight letters form my first and last name. My title, 16.
  An ampersand for flair. That’s 25 characters that made up my logo. That’s
  how it felt. When I looked at my logo, I saw 25 characters standing alone next to each other.
  It felt like 25 solos. My goal with this iteration was to make those
  characters feel like an ensemble cast. A cast of characters that work together
  to convey more meaning than their underlying shapes could alone. This is
  what I came up with.

<h2>The Feeling</h2>
<p>
  Sturdy. Dense. Heavy. Kinetic. Those are adjectives I wanted to use to describe my logo.
  I wanted this logo to feel like it was about to leap off the screen, burst through
  your wall, and crash onto your floor. I kept seeing a flag blowing from West to East.
  A constant fluid motion. How that fits with dense and heavy, I don’t know either,
  but that’s where my head was. So, I started there.
</p>

<h2>The Work</h2>
<p>
  I’ve written about this process before. In
  “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/a-logo-design-process/">A Logo Design Process</a>”
  I wrote about iterating 2011’s logo into 2014’s logo. I didn’t write about
  progressing 2014’s logo to 2018’s, but the process was similar. My logo is like
  this site. I wrote in <a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020/">this series’ opener</a>
  that I “…remember thinking this would be my last site.” Same for the logo.
  I haven’t thrown the logo out and started new since 2014. I’m using the same
  foundation, the same vectors to get to the next incarnation.
</p>

<p>
  This time around went fast. Odd fast. I didn’t sketch anything. I could see
  the chunkiness, the togetherness that I wanted in my head.
  I created a new Illustrator file and pasted the 2018 vectors in. Then got to it.
</p>

<h3>Little Flat Feet</h3>
<p>
  In “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020-typography/">Realign 2020: Typography</a>”
  I mentioned I took inspiration from Proto Grotesk for the logo.
</p>

<h2>The Rest</h2>
<p>
  When I look at the before and after I see something other than aesthetic
  improvements. I see personal progress. When you’ve been doing this work as long
  as I have, it’s easy to forget that you’re still capable of progression. When
  I look at 2018 vs. 2020 I can see how much I’ve learned. I’ve learned
  how to use the tools better. I’ve learned how to see better. I’ve moved a
  couple steps closer to tricking the computer to show what’s really in my head.
  It feels great to know I’m still learning. Still growing. Still going.
</p>

<p>
  I’ll continue this series in a few days with “Realign 2020: ?.”
