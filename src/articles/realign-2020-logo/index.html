<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020">Realign 2020</a>” series.
  In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of this site.
  I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design
  and content will evolve through the series and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  Eight letters form my first and last name. My title? 16.
  Plan an ampersand for flair. That’s 25 characters that made up my logo. That’s
  how it felt. When I looked at my logo, I saw 25 characters standing alone next to each other.
  It felt like 25 solos. My goal with this iteration was to make those
  characters feel like an ensemble cast. A cast of shapes that work together
  to convey more meaning than their underlying letters could alone.

<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>
  I’ve written about this process before. In
  “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/a-logo-design-process/">A Logo Design Process</a>”
  I wrote about iterating 2011’s logo into 2014’s logo. In that, I also used
  the word spindly to describe the logo early in the process. That feeling that
  the logo isn’t chunky enough as obviously stuck in my brain.
</p>

<p>
  This time around went fast. Odd fast. I didn’t sketch anything. I could see
  the chunkiness and the togetherness that I wanted in my head. So I set to it.
  I created a new Illustrator file and pasted the 2018 vectors in.
</p>

<p>
  I’ll continue this series in a few days with “Realign 2020: ?.”
