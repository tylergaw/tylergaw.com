  description: Updating this site’s typography during the 2020 realign.

<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020">Realign 2020</a>” series.
  In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of this site.
  I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design
  and content will evolve through the series and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  The fonts I’ve chosen for this site have run the gamut over the years. Handwritten,
  illustrated, web-safe only, monospaced, serif, questionable, and so on. The
  last few years I’ve leaned on chunky, sturdy fonts. Fonts that—to me—say;
  “hard work gets done here.” That fits my approach to design and engineering.
</p>
<p>
  For this iteration, I wanted that same sturdiness. I also wanted more room to play.
  I wanted to use more weights than I have in the past and, when possible, I wanted
  to make things weird.
</p>
<p>
  After a long search and plenty of playing with different faces, I’ve settled
  on a font that will serve the design and content well for years to come.
</p>

<h2>
  Proto Grotesk
</h2>
<p>
  If you’re reading this on my site, these sentences are now set in
  <a href="https://www.productiontype.com/family/proto_grotesk">Production Type’s lovely Proto Grotesk</a>. I’ve chosen the light
  weight for the base body copy. The regular weight feels too heavy for large
  swaths of copy.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
  I’m using the bold weight for certain headings and navigation items. I have
  small doses of all caps here and there.
</p>
<p>
  The extra light weight is coming in handy for blog post titles. I want those
  to be commanding without hitting you over the head as much as a bold or heavier
  weight can.
</p>

<p>
  As I iterate, I’m looking forward experimenting more with
  weights and sizes and styles. It also has fun alternate numerals and other
  glyphs that I’m hoping to make use of when appropriate.
</p>

<h3>
  Why this typeface?
</h3>
<p>
  I learned about Proto Grotesk via Bethany Heck’s <a href="https://fontreviewjournal.com/proto-grotesk/">excellent Font Review Journal</a>.
  A lot of what she detailed in the review is what draws me to it. Its
  idiosyncrasies stick out enough to make it playful, without reducing
  reading comfort.
</p>
<p>
  The designer’s description is a prefect description of what I’m looking for.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    …there’s no reason type can’t be both steadfast and peculiar…its posture is nothing less than sturdy and forthright. Proto Grotesk is strange but steady.
  </p>
  <cite>
    <a href="https://www.productiontype.com/family/proto_grotesk">Production Type - Proto Grotesk</a>
  </cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  One detail I really dig are the little “flat feet”, as I’ve been
  referring to them. The lowercase “y” and “a” are the best examples. Something
  about that abrubt, a little too long bit catches my eye. I took cues
  from it as I was updating my logo. I’ll write more about that in another post.
</p>

<p>
  Along with all that, I think Proto Grotesk just looks super cool.
</p>

<h3>
  Cost
</h3>
<p>
  This was the most expensive font I’ve bought for a personal project.
  My bill was about $400. That bought me all four weights with a desktop and
  web license. That’s a big buy, but it feels cool to directly support a
  type design studio.
</p>
<p>
  Production type offers trial downloads of their fonts. Being able to try the
  font in Sketch and in browser made all the difference. By the time I clicked
  “purchase” I’d been using Proto Grotesk in real settings for weeks.
</p>
<p>
  Those trials also helped me experiment with other fonts and weed out ones that
  weren’t working. There were a few that looked great on Production’s site, but
  didn’t work in the context of my design.
</p>

<h2>
  Implementation
</h2>
<p>
  I’ve used Typekit on this site for about eight years. It’s served me well, but I don’t
  want to load fonts from a third party anymore. I want to self-host. That was a
  smaller reason to go with Proto Grotesk too. Not that it’s the only font I
  could self-host, but it also checked that box.
</p>
<p>
  Because I’m self-hosting, I need to load fonts in a performat way. I spent time
  reading up on font loading methods. Zach’s post “<a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/">A Comprehensive Guide to Font Loading Strategies</a>”
  is <strong>the</strong> place for that info.
</p>
<p>
  I didn’t end up using one of Zach’s gold standards. I wasn’t ready to introduce JavaScript
  to assist in font loading. Wanted a HTML/CSS only approach for now. I have
  other performance improvements to make in the future, so I’ll revist
  font loading then.
</p>
<p>
  I went with a combination of approaches in the post.
  I’m using; standard <code>@font-face</code>, <code>font-display</code>, and
  preloading. In the <code>head</code> I preload two of the four weights I use.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel="preload" href="/fonts/protogroteskweb-light.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/fonts/protogroteskweb-bold.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
  I don’t preload the regular and extra light weights because I don’t use them
  in critical styles. They can load later via <code>@font-face</code> without
  bothering anything.
</p>

<p>
  From there, I include a standard <code>@font-face</code> rule for each weight in my critical inline styles.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">/* repeated for each font weight */
  @font-face {
  font-display: swap;
  font-family: "protogrotesk-bold";
  src: url("/fonts/protogroteskweb-bold.woff2");
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Using <code>swap</code> for <code>font-display</code> helps avoid a flash of
  invisible content. There’s a slight shimmy when my custom font loads, but
  I can deal with that.
</p>

<h3>Custom properties</h3>
<p>
  I use CSS custom properties for font stacks.
  Again in my critical inline styles, I have n
  property for each font weight.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">--font-proto-extralight: "protogrotesk-extralight", helvetica, sans-serif;
--font-proto-light: "protogrotesk-light", helvetica, sans-serif;
--font-proto-regular: "protogrotesk-regular", helvetica, sans-serif;
--font-proto-bold: "protogrotesk-bold", helvetica, sans-serif;</code></pre>

<p>
  Declaring those stacks as custom props makes it so I don’t have to repeat myself.
  Also, lets me type less:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">font-family: var(--font-proto-bold);</code></pre>

<h2>Next</h2>
<p>
  A site’s typography is never “done”, only out there. I’ll continue to make
  improvements and experiment over time. If you’re interested in a before and
  after, I archived the site previous to this change at <a href="https://v6.tylergaw.com">v6.tylergaw.com</a>
</p>
<p>
  I’ll continue this series with “Realign 2020: Logo” in a few days.
