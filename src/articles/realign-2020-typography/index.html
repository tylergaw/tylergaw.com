<p class="entry-intro">
  This is part of my “<a href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020"
    >Realign 2020</a
  >” series. In it, I document my process during a content and design realign of
  this site. I’ll update the site piece-by-piece as I post. The design and
  content will evolve through the series and beyond.
</p>

<p>
  The fonts I’ve chosen for this site have run the gamut over the years.
  Handwritten, illustrated, web-safe only, monospaced, serif, questionable, and
  so on. The last few years I’ve leaned on chunky, sturdy fonts. Fonts that—to
  me—say; “hard work gets done here.” That fits my approach to design and
  engineering.
</p>
<p>
  For this iteration, I wanted that same sturdiness. I also wanted more room to
  play. I wanted to use more weights than I have in the past and, when possible,
  I wanted to make things strange.
</p>
<p>
  After a long search and plenty of playing with different faces, I’ve settled
  on a font that will serve the design and content well for at least a couple
  years.
</p>

<h2>
  Proto Grotesk
</h2>
<p>
  If you’re reading this on my site, these sentences are now set in
  <a href="https://www.productiontype.com/family/proto_grotesk"
    >Production Type’s lovely Proto Grotesk</a
  >. I’ve chosen the light weight for the base body copy. The regular weight
  feels too heavy for large swaths of copy.
</p>

    alt="A sampling of Proto Grotesk in various weights and sizes"
  />
</figure>
<p>
  I’m using the bold weight for certain headings and navigation items. I have
  small doses of all caps here and there.
</p>
<p>
  The extra light weight is coming in handy for blog post titles. I want those
  to be commanding without hitting you over the head as much as a bold or
  heavier weight can.
</p>

<p>
  As I iterate, I’m looking forward to experimenting more with weights and sizes
  and styles. Proto Grotesk also has fun alternate numerals and other alt glyphs
  that I’m hoping to make use of when appropriate.
</p>

<h3>
  Why this typeface?
</h3>
<p>
  I learned about Proto Grotesk via Bethany Heck’s
  <a href="https://fontreviewjournal.com/proto-grotesk/"
    >excellent Font Review Journal</a
  >. A lot of what she detailed in the review is what draws me to the typeface.
  Its idiosyncrasies stick out enough to make it playful, without reducing
  reading comfort.
</p>
<p>
  The designer’s description is a perfect summary of what I’m looking for.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    …there’s no reason type can’t be both steadfast and peculiar…its posture is
    nothing less than sturdy and forthright. Proto Grotesk is strange but
    steady.
  </p>
  <cite>
    <a href="https://www.productiontype.com/family/proto_grotesk"
      >Production Type - Proto Grotesk</a
    >
  </cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  One detail I really dig are the little “flat feet”, as I’ve been referring to
  them. The lowercase “y” and “a” are the best examples. Something about that
  abrupt, a little too long bit catches my eye. I took cues from it as I was
  updating my logo. I’ll write about that in a future post.
</p>

<p>
  Along with all that, I think Proto Grotesk just looks super cool. Sometimes
  that’s enough.
</p>

<h3>
  Cost
</h3>
<p>
  This was the most expensive font I’ve bought for a personal project. My bill
  was about $400 USD. That bought me all four weights with a desktop and web
  license. That’s a big buy for me, but it feels worth it and it’s cool to
  directly support a type design studio.
</p>
<p>
  Production Type offers trial downloads of their fonts. Being able to try the
  font in design programs and in browsers made all the difference. By the time I
  clicked “purchase”. I’d been using Proto Grotesk in real settings for weeks.
</p>
<p>
  Those trials also helped me experiment with other fonts and weed out ones that
  weren’t working. There were a few that looked great on Production’s site, but
  didn’t work in the context of my design.
</p>

<h2>
  Implementation
</h2>
<p>
  I’ve used Typekit on this site for about eight years. It’s served me well, but
  I don’t want to load fonts from a third party anymore. I want to self-host.
  That was a smaller reason to go with Proto Grotesk too. Not that it’s the only
  font I could self-host, but it checked that box.
</p>
<p>
  Because I’m self-hosting, I need to load fonts in a performat way. I spent
  time catching up on font loading methods. They move fast. Zach’s post “<a
    href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/comprehensive-webfonts/"
    >A Comprehensive Guide to Font Loading Strategies</a
  >” is <strong>the</strong> place for that info.
</p>
<p>
  I didn’t end up using one of Zach’s gold standards. I wasn’t ready to
  introduce JavaScript to assist in font loading. I wanted an HTML/CSS only
  approach for now. I have other performance improvements to make in the future,
  so I’ll revisit font loading then.
</p>
<p>
  I went with a combination of approaches in the post. I’m using; standard
  <code>@font-face</code>, <code>font-display</code>, and preloading. In the
  <code>head</code> of my pages I preload two of the four weights I use.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel="preload" href="/fonts/protogroteskweb-light.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/fonts/protogroteskweb-bold.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
  I don’t preload the regular and extra light weights because I don’t use them
  in critical styles. They can load later via <code>@font-face</code> without
  bothering anything.
</p>

<p>
  From there, I include a standard <code>@font-face</code> rule for each weight
  in my critical inline styles.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">/* repeated for each font weight */
@font-face {
  font-display: swap;
  font-family: "protogrotesk-bold";
  src: url("/fonts/protogroteskweb-bold.woff2");
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Using <code>swap</code> for <code>font-display</code> helps avoid a flash of
  invisible content. There’s a slight shimmy when the custom font loads, but I
  can deal with that.
</p>

<h3>Custom properties</h3>
<p>
  I use CSS custom properties for font stacks. Again in my critical inline
  styles, I have a property for each font weight.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">--font-proto-extralight: "protogrotesk-extralight", helvetica, sans-serif;
--font-proto-light: "protogrotesk-light", helvetica, sans-serif;
--font-proto-regular: "protogrotesk-regular", helvetica, sans-serif;
--font-proto-bold: "protogrotesk-bold", helvetica, sans-serif;</code></pre>

<p>
  Declaring those stacks as custom props makes it so I don’t have to repeat
  myself. It also lets me type less when using each weight:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">font-family: var(--font-proto-bold);</code></pre>

<h2>Next</h2>
<p>
  A site’s typography is never “done”, only out there. I’ll keep making
  improvements and experimenting over time. If you’re interested in a before and
  after, I archived the site previous to this change at
  <a href="https://v6.tylergaw.com">v6.tylergaw.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I’ll continue this series in a few days with “<a
    href="https://tylergaw.com/articles/realign-2020-logo"
    >Realign 2020: Logo</a
  >.”
