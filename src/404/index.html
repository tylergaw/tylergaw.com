<h1>404</h1>
<p>
  I try to maintain all links to my site.
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs Don’t Change</a>.
  Or at least provide a proper 301 redirect.
</p>
<p>
  If you landed on a dead link, I’d appreciate it if you could let me know.
  Either via email at me@tylergaw.com or Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/tylergaw">@tylergaw</a>.
