<h2>Random Work Thoughts</h2>
<p>
  If you don’t write it down, it’s not real. Written communication is the most
  important skill of any team member. Remote-first teams have the healthiest
  communication for everyone, not just remote members. Code is just a means to
  an end, except when it isn’t. People aren’t edge cases.
  There’s no such thing as a “flat” organization, power structures exist even
  if they’re not in writing. Black lives matter. I still don’t know how to set
  up a cron job on the command line.
