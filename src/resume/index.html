          I got to work with the wonderful <a href="https://longform.org">Longform</a>
          team to finish the design of their in-progress iOS app. The designs
          we produced later got a nod from Apple by way of…hrm…an inspired
          similar design in their news app.

          contacted me out of the blue one day and asked me to design and build
          him a new website. He said he got in touch with me because I seemed
          “a little unhinged” and that’s what he wanted in a site.

          My first job working with the Web. Started part time the last month of
          college. Wrote a ton of Actionscript and PHP. Knew all of the IE6 CSS
          work arounds. Still remember how excited we were when IE7 came out
          and had transparent png support.

  <h2>Random Work Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    If you don’t write it down, it’s not real. Written communication is the most
    important skill of any team member. Remote-first teams have the healthiest
    communication for everyone, not just remote members. Code is just a means to
    an end, except when it isn’t. People aren’t edge cases.
    There’s no such thing as a “flat” organization, power structures exist even
    if they’re not in writing. Black lives matter. I still don’t know how to set
    up a cron job on the command line.
