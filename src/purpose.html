<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
  I believe I can use my imagination and skills to improve the quality of life
  of others. With that in mind, I aim to build things
  that are useful, helpful, enjoyable, and thought-provoking.
</p>
<p>
  I want to help others recognize their endless capacity for creative thinking.
  By thinking, speaking, and living creatively I hope to show that there are no set
  rules for how they should think or approach their work, business, career, and life.
</p>
<p>
  I’m also figuring all this out as I go. I’ll surely update the contents of this page
  as time goes on.
