<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
    I believe I can use my imagination and skills to improve the quality of life
    of others. With that in mind, I aim to build things
    that are useful, helpful, enjoyable, and thought-provoking.
</p>
<p>
    I want to help others recognize their endless capacity for creative thinking.
    By thinking, speaking, and living creatively I hope to show that there are no set
    rules for how they should think or approach their work, business, career, and life.
</p>
<p>
    I’m also figuring all this out as I go. I’ll surely update the contents of this page
    as time goes on.
