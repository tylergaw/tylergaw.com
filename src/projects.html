            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>
                This is a selection of personal open-source projects and work
                done while employed at a design consultancy.

            <h2>Readability</h2>
            <p>
                The Web has a wealth of excellent content worth reading. It’s
                also full of hard to read sites and has no shortage of things
                competing for your attention. I worked with a team of excellent
                folks to make the Web a more comfortable place to read.

            <h2>Readlists</h2>
            <p>
                Articles, recipes, course materials, etc. are all valuable in single
                servings. Sometimes though groups of written content are best
                experienced as a package. I worked with a small team to design and
                build a site to bundle Web pages into portable formats.

            <h2>Jribbble</h2>
            <p>
                Jribbble is a jQuery plugin that I created and maintain.
                It allows you to fetch shot and player information from the
                Dribbble API.

            <h2>CSS True Titles</h2>
            <p>
                The opening titles of the show True Detective are incredible.
                I wanted to see if I could create a similar style title
                sequence using CSS.

            <h2>The Man From Hollywood</h2>
            <p>
                Could CSS be used to make a kinectic type animation? I thought
                so. TMFH is an early demo pushing the limits of CSS
                animations.

            <h2>CSS Shaky Animation</h2>
            <p>
                I've always loved the shaky animation style of a lot of cartoons.
                This demo brings that style to the browser with some CSS trickery.

            <h2>CSS Write-on Text Effect</h2>
            <p>
                Handwritten text scribbled onto the screen is a common
                effect in motion graphics. In this demo I recreate the effect
                using CSS.

            <p>
                I love drawing goofy things with Paper. I wanted an easy way to
                self-host my drawings. I built this so I could publish directly
                from the app.

                I went and read one typography book and thought I needed to make

                A free Saturday and lots of coffee brought about
                this site that offers an at-a-glance view of all the latest
                and greatest design shots from Dribbble.

                Did I just recreate animated gifs using only CSS animations?
                Pretty sure I did! Might not be the most practical thing, but
                it’s darn cool!
