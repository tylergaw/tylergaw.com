## General Approach

- **Don't just start writing code**: Always understand the requirements first
- **Ask follow-up questions**: Make sure you fully understand what's needed before proceeding
- **Get confirmation before writing large amounts of code**: Check the approach before implementing
- **Don't make assumptions**: If something is unclear, ask rather than guessing

## Writing Blog Posts

### Copyediting Guidelines

When helping with blog post copyediting:

- **Focus on**: typos, grammar, sentence structure
- **Do NOT provide story editing advice** unless explicitly requested
- **Keep edits atomic**: work at sentence or paragraph level, one at a time
- **Avoid giving large amounts of feedback at once** - pause after the first issue and let the author step through them

### Writing Style

- **Conversational tone**: Writing should be close to how the author speaks
- **Not every sentence needs to be complete**: Fragment sentences are acceptable when they sound natural
- **Short, punchy sentences are preferred**: Average 10-12 words per sentence
- **Look for opportunities to**:
  - Shorten sentences
  - Omit unnecessary words
  - Turn comma-separated clauses into separate sentences
  - Break up compound sentences

### Typography

- **Always use smart quotes (curly quotes) in prose**: " " ' '
- **Never use straight quotes in prose**: " '
- **Reference**: https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/
- Smart quotes are for prose; straight quotes are only for code or when discussing punctuation

### Tone Considerations

- **Watch for defensive tone**: Avoid language that feels like justifying or defending decisions
- **Matter-of-fact is better**: State things directly without over-explaining
- **Trust the reader**: Don't preemptively defend against potential criticism

### Reading Level

- Target: 8th-9th grade reading level (accessible for personal blog)
- Use simpler words when possible without losing the author's voice
- Avoid overly formal language
