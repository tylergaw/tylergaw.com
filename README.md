My personal website since 2006.

## Local development.

This is static site built with Eleventy.

Install node dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Run and initial build then start the development server and watchers.

```
yarn start
```

For one-off builds:

```
yarn build
```

## Deploying

Since late 2019, this site is hosted on Netlify. Production deploys happen automatically when pushing to `master`. All pull requests get a preview deploy.
