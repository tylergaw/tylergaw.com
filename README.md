Personal site that will house my projects, info and the occasional blog post on topics related to the work I do on the web. Shit, I might even write a post or two about getting drunk and starting fights.

### Technologies
* The whole kit and kaboodle is running on the demon-fast, Lara Flynn Boyle light [Nginx](http://nginx.org) web server.
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org) for super sexy, super organized CSS.
* [Typekit](http://typekit.com). I'm using [Chaparral Pro](http://typekit.com/fonts/chaparral-pro) for my body copy and [Inconsolata](https://typekit.com/fonts/inconsolata) for headings and such.

### Hosting
Everything will live on a fantastic 256 MB Slice at [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com). Which I am acting as sys admin for, so most likely things are going to totally shit the bed at some point in the near future.
