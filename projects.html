                    I love drawing goofy things with Paper. I wanted a way to
                    put all my drawings on the Web. Papersaver allows me to
                    publish directly from the app.

                    Branched out and tried something new on this one. I went and
                    read one typography book and think I need to make my own hand-drawn
                    typeface. This guy!

                    Would it be possible to create a kinetic type animation using
                    CSS? I thought so. TMFH is a first-of-its kind demo of
                    how far CSS animation can be taken.

                    You know what your site needs? More jQuery! Jribbble is a jQuery
                    plugin for requesting shot and player information from the
                    Dribbble API.

                </a>
                <p>
                    I've always loved the shaky animation style of a lot of cartoons.
                    This demo brings that style to the browser with some CSS
                    tricks and a little elbow grease.

                    Handwritten text being drawn onto the screen is a common
                    effect in motion graphics. In this demo I recreate that effect
                    using web technologies.

                    A free Saturday and a couple pots of coffee brought about
                    this site that offers an at-a-glance view of all the latest
                    and greatest design snaps from Dribbble.

                    Wait, did I just recreate animated gifs using only CSS animations?
                    I sure as hell did. Might not be the most practical thing, but
                    it sure is cool!
