                        The opening titles of the show True Detective are incredible.
                        I wanted to see if I could create a similar style title
                        sequence using CSS.

                        After an incredible 5+ years, I made the difficult decision
                        to move on from my position at Arc90 and Readability.
                        This is an account of my time there.

                        wrote a small tool to make it a little easier.

                        I was looking for a way for Javascript to know when a media query condition was met or not met. While window.matchMedia provides the main functionality, I wanted something that was a little more automatic.

                Side projects can be great opportunities to flex some muscle on new skills. In this article I discuss doing just that with a side project in need of a facelift.

                It was a silly "pop-in-your-head-in-the-shower" idea. Kinetic type with CSS. Is that possible? Will browsers just die under the stress? I had to find out.

                Web design is hard, that's why it's fun and why not everyone does it. With this I'll explain why I take some joy in dealing with the sticky situations that "that" browser gets me in.

                Version 2 of tylergaw.com carried me through a year of freelancing and helped me land my current gig at Arc90. But after two years it's starting to show its age. Version 3 is a step in a new direction and as always a challenging and fun undertaking.
