                        The Web Video Text Track format is easy enough to work
                        with, but marking cue times can be a bit of a chore. I
                        wrote a small tool to make it a little easier.

                        I was looking for a way for Javascript to know when a media query condition was met or not met. While window.matchMedia provides the main functionality, I wanted something that was a little more automatic.

                        HTML form validation is evolving in a big way. In this little ditty I lay out a process for making browser generated validation errors super sexy!

                Side projects can be great opportunities to flex some muscle on new skills. In this article I discuss doing just that with a side project in need of a facelift.

                I've been attending the Refresh NYC meet-ups as of late. At our last meet-up I volunteered to do a presentation on some new and exciting things happening with CSS.

                It was a silly "pop-in-your-head-in-the-shower" idea. Kinetic type with CSS. Is that possible? Will browsers just die under the stress? I had to find out.

                Web design is hard, that's why it's fun and why not everyone does it. With this I'll explain why I take some joy in dealing with the sticky situations that "that" browser gets me in.

                Version 2 of tylergaw.com carried me through a year of freelancing and helped me land my current gig at Arc90. But after two years it's starting to show its age. Version 3 is a step in a new direction and as always a challenging and fun undertaking.
