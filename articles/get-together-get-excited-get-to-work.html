                If you haven't heard, Brooklyn is <b>the</b> place to be the
                second week of October 2012. That's the week that the Internet
                is getting together for a week of conferences, meet ups, drink-ups,
                shinanagans, and the friendliest little web build-a-thon that could.
                It just so happens that that build-a-thon is being organized and
                hosted by myself and <a href="https://twitter.com/xiian">Tom Sartain</a>.
                We'd love for you to join us!
            </p>
            <h2>What's this &#8220;build-a-thon&#8221;?</h2>
            <p>
                Alright, here's the deal. If you're a designer or a developer I
                know you have at least one project in your mind right now
                that you want to work on. And there's a good chance you've
                been thinking about working on this project for a while and for
                one reason or another haven't been able to dive in and get it done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brooklyn Alpha is a perfect excuse to give yourself three days
                to put your idea into motion. Not only will you have three days, you'll
                have access to other motivated folks who may have complementary
                skills. Maybe you're a designer who needs a Python developer. Or
                you're Mr. Django himself and you need a designer to help
                make your project easy to use and easy on the eyes. Or maybe you're someone
                who has a head full of great ideas and you're looking for
                designers and developers to lend a hand in materializing all that
                greatness coming from your grey matter. Whatever your situation
                we'll have you covered.
            </p>
            <h2>&#8220;I don't have any ideas&#8221;</h2>
            <p>
                OK, OK. The brain well done gone dry. It happens to the best of us.
                Can you sling hot pixels or code? Of course you can. Then you should
                come to Brooklyn Alpha. Here's why. Last year when we opened up
                the floor to anyone to get up and pitch ideas, nearly every
                single one of our incredible attendees got up and did just that.
                And more than a few got up a second or third time. There will be
                no shortage of excellent ideas at Alpha and many of them will need
                your brain to get them moving.
            </p>
            <h2>OK, cool. What else?</h2>
            <p>
                I'll tell you what else. You get to be a part of something that's
                going to be huge. Brooklyn Alpha is sharing the week with the
                legendary <a href="https://brooklynbeta.org/">Brooklyn Beta</a>
                and we're an official part of <a href="https://brooklynbeta.org/beyond">Beyond Beta</a>.
                If you haven't heard of those stop reading this now and go find out
                about them (then hurry back and pick up your ticket to Alpha).
            </p>
            <p>
                Brooklyn Alpha will be taking place during the day each of its
                three days. That leaves the evenings free for maximum mingling
                with a whole host of excellent web folks that will for sure be
                inhabiting our incredible Borough of Brooklyn during the week.
            </p>
            <h2>Hope to see you there!</h2>
            <p>
                This is our second year hosting Brooklyn Alpha. It's a challenging,
                fun, and rewarding task to take on. We're doing this because
                we love the work we do, we love the city we live in, and we love
                the web community that makes events like this possible. We're
                honored to be able to surround ourselves with so many people that
                share our passions.
